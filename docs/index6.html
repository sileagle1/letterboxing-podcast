                        If anyone can get any field recordings of interesting nature sounds, 
I'd love to use them. It's OK if you can identify the sounds as long as 
you give the location information.

                        Episode 2 is nearly ready to go. I have an intro my Music Woman and
her recording describing her letterboxing on Dartmoor. I'm also

Anyone have...

I have to be the first to admit that I had my letterboxing birthday
