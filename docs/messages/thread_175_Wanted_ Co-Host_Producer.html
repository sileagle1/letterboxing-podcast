                    <div class="plaintext-content">It makes me sad that I have been pretty swamped this fall with work,<br>
and starting my own business, and haven't had as much time to devote<br>
to getting Letterpod episodes on air.  My sincerest apologies to all<br>
the Letterpod fans out there.<br>
<br>
I would like to try to fix this problem by posting this open<br>
invitation for a co-host/producer for the Letterpod.<br>
<br>
I am happy to announce that I am an expecting father, and lord<br>
willing, will be up late nights beginning in June.  So I can for see<br>
that starting in June I may also have less time to devote to the<br>
Letterpod.<br>
<br>
However, I do NOT want to abandon it.  It's too much fun.  However, I<br>
would like some fresh blood poured into the show (that sounds kind of<br>
gruesome actually).<br>
<br>
So, if there is anyone out there willing to produce some shows, and<br>
serve as host, I would love to trade off these duties.  Maybe we can<br>
do alternating shows, or however it works out.<br>
<br>
The basics are this, the co-host/producer would need some editing<br>
software...I use Garageband on the MAC, but Audacity is a free program<br>
that might work for you on a PC or MAC.  You will need a<br>
computer/laptop that has a microphone, or one you can plug in.  That's<br>
about it!  Most of what I do is collect audio files from others, put<br>
them together, add some music (which is all really simple in<br>
Garageband) and that's a show.  I do record some phone calls for<br>
interview and segments, and that set-up isn't simple, but if something<br>
like that is needed, I certainly can do that, and send the<br>
co-host/producer an audio file of it.<br>
<br>
I will pass along passwords and whatnot to Podbean.com, so you can<br>
learn how to post to the web page.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know it sound like a lot, but with sharing these duties with<br>
me, it probably won't be so rough.  I'll guide you every step of the way.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you are interested in taking an active role in the<br>
Letterpod like this, shoot me an email so I can answer any questions<br>
you might have.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Those late nights are actually bonding time :-)<br>
<br>
I just want to thank you for rescuing the podcasts when they were on their way out. You've <br>
done such a great job. <br>
<br>
I can understand your situation, as I'm in the middle of a career refocus myself (I never <br>
thought illustration work would get outsourced to India and China...). In any event, I've <br>
had to pour more energy into new directions with my work and less into letterboxing and <br>
the podcast. So, I can't fill the role of co producer but I just know the fresh blood will be a <br>
welcome addition<br>
<br>
I still have several contributions sitting on my iPod which I'll get to you after the holidays.<br>
<br>
Best of luck with all your new adventures!<br>
<br>

interview and segments, and that set-up isn't simple, but if something<br/>
like that is needed, I certainly can do that, and send the<br/>
co-host/producer an audio file of it.<br/>
<br/>
I will pass along passwords and whatnot to Podbean.com, so you can<br/>
learn how to post to the web page.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know it sound like a lot, but with sharing these duties with<br/>
me, it probably won't be so rough. I'll guide you every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are interested in taking an active role in the<br/>
Letterpod like this, shoot me an email so I can answer any questions<br/>
you might have.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks to all that wished me well wishes in parenthood.  Thanks to all<br>
those of you who have offered to help do some hosting and producing! <br>
I am compiling a list of contacts to create a list of people who want<br>
an active role in hosting and producing new episodes.  I would like to<br>
create this list on AQ, since it is so easy, but if you are not on AQ,<br>
that's OK, let me know, and I'll get you the info.  If you don't get a<br>
message from me on AQ shortly, let me know so I can add you to the list.<br>

Keep those ideas coming, I'm listening.<br>
