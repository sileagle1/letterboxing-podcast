and starting my own business, and haven't had as much time to devote<br/>
to getting Letterpod episodes on air.  My sincerest apologies to all<br/>
the Letterpod fans out there.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to try to fix this problem by posting this open<br/>
invitation for a co-host/producer for the Letterpod.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to announce that I am an expecting father, and lord<br/>
willing, will be up late nights beginning in June.  So I can for see<br/>
that starting in June I may also have less time to devote to the<br/>
Letterpod.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do NOT want to abandon it.  It's too much fun.  However, I<br/>
would like some fresh blood poured into the show (that sounds kind of<br/>
gruesome actually).<br/>
<br/>
So, if there is anyone out there willing to produce some shows, and<br/>
serve as host, I would love to trade off these duties.  Maybe we can<br/>
do alternating shows, or however it works out.<br/>
<br/>
The basics are this, the co-host/producer would need some editing<br/>
software...I use Garageband on the MAC, but Audacity is a free program<br/>
that might work for you on a PC or MAC.  You will need a<br/>
computer/laptop that has a microphone, or one you can plug in.  That's<br/>
about it!  Most of what I do is collect audio files from others, put<br/>
them together, add some music (which is all really simple in<br/>
Garageband) and that's a show.  I do record some phone calls for<br/>
interview and segments, and that set-up isn't simple, but if something<br/>
like that is needed, I certainly can do that, and send the<br/>
co-host/producer an audio file of it.<br/>
<br/>
I will pass along passwords and whatnot to Podbean.com, so you can<br/>
learn how to post to the web page.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know it sound like a lot, but with sharing these duties with<br/>
me, it probably won't be so rough.  I'll guide you every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are interested in taking an active role in the<br/>
Letterpod like this, shoot me an email so I can answer any questions<br/>
you might have.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Those late nights are actually bonding time :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just want to thank you for rescuing the podcasts when they were on their way out. You've <br/>
done such a great job. <br/>
<br/>
I can understand your situation, as I'm in the middle of a career refocus myself (I never <br/>
thought illustration work would get outsourced to India and China...). In any event, I've <br/>
had to pour more energy into new directions with my work and less into letterboxing and <br/>
the podcast. So, I can't fill the role of co producer but I just know the fresh blood will be a <br/>
welcome addition<br/>
<br/>
I still have several contributions sitting on my iPod which I'll get to you after the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck with all your new adventures!<br/>
<br/>

that might work for you on a PC or MAC. You will need a<br/>
computer/laptop that has a microphone, or one you can plug in. That's<br/>
about it! Most of what I do is collect audio files from others, put<br/>
them together, add some music (which is all really simple in<br/>
Garageband) and that's a show. I do record some phone calls for<br/>
interview and segments, and that set-up isn't simple, but if something<br/>
like that is needed, I certainly can do that, and send the<br/>
co-host/producer an audio file of it.<br/>
<br/>
I will pass along passwords and whatnot to Podbean.com, so you can<br/>
learn how to post to the web page.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know it sound like a lot, but with sharing these duties with<br/>
me, it probably won't be so rough. I'll guide you every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are interested in taking an active role in the<br/>
Letterpod like this, shoot me an email so I can answer any questions<br/>
you might have.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks to all that wished me well wishes in parenthood.  Thanks to all<br/>
those of you who have offered to help do some hosting and producing! <br/>
I am compiling a list of contacts to create a list of people who want<br/>
an active role in hosting and producing new episodes.  I would like to<br/>
create this list on AQ, since it is so easy, but if you are not on AQ,<br/>
that's OK, let me know, and I'll get you the info.  If you don't get a<br/>
message from me on AQ shortly, let me know so I can add you to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Keep those ideas coming, I'm listening.<br/>
