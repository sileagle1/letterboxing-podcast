Along as I purchase a head set and download this Audacity software I <br>
should be set to go?<br>

Silly question number 2 from the kokopellian, these podcasts can be <br>
uploaded to standard yahoo groups? I was curious because several <br>
members of the Crazy Boxing Buddies site (Including Orion) and I have <br>
discussed podcast presentations available on the site.....<br>
<br>
Thank you by the way for organizing this John!<br>

In theory, I'd imagine they can--at least as an mp3--but there's a<br>
quota on the amount of disk space you can use for each group so it's<br>
not very practical.<br>
