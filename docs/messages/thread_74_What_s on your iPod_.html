<br/>
a) the gym.<br/>
b) in my iHome dock next to my work desk.<br/>
c) in my car via the iTrip (books on tape work great there!).<br/>
and finally, <br/>
c) as an alternative to TV some nights. I love to lie in bed and drift off to Mystery Theater, <br/>
LOST podcasts or Lime and Violet knitting podcasts. I love the fact that I can program my <br/>
favorite things for later (thank you NPR!). <br/>
<br/>
I agree about not wanting to hike or walk with the iPod and miss nature's show!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
who's wondering what others are listening to...<br/>
