Well, I guess you could email each of them and get permission, but<br/>
maybe this group was pretty big!  Maybe you don't really know all of<br/>
them (I wouldn't at a big gathering).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask the host/hostess of the event to send out an email<br/>
to all the sign-ups and let them know that you were recording for this<br/>
project, and if anyone who was present and would object, to contact you.<br/>
<br/>
If they are just in the background noise, I don't think you have to<br/>
got through that.  As far as identifying each of the speakers, I don't<br/>
think you have to do that if it is obviously a group give and take<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents.<br/>

I think the pieces that I'm going to use won't be a problem because those particular boxers <br/>
knew about the iPod. I want to use snippets of the background stuff as part of my intro, so <br/>
that shouldn't be a problem either. Sampling, as it were... I can't wait to get into <br/>
GarageBand with this stuff!<br/>
<br/>
I also want to sit down with the WildCats. They have some good tales :-) <br/>

What I have is a device called a Micro Memo that just pops on to the bottom of my iPod. It <br/>
then sets up my iPod to record digitally. I can record anywhere with the Micro Memo, so I <br/>
like that. Then I just hook my iPod into the computer and it will download the recordings <br/>
there. Once in the computer, I play around in GarageBand (a Mac program-there's others <br/>
you can download for the PC). That's the fun part! You can also buy a USB mic that <br/>
connects into your computer and record that way. The key is to record something digitally <br/>
and put it into a program.<br/>
<br/>
   I'll look around on the internet and try to post some good podcasting tutorials. The <br/>
more people contributing will make for more interesting podcasts. Go for it!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

No worries, gone are the days of popping in a cassette and hitting<br/>
record...didnt' we take that for granted!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, its more complicated now, but its not that much harder.  First<br/>
check out this new page I started to see if it helps..<br/>
http://letterpod.podbean.com/podcasting-basics/<br/>
<br/>
Like Orion said, basically you are now recording digitally, instead of<br/>
to a tape.  The sound is converted to a digital file, which when<br/>
played back sounds like sound.  So how do you record digitally.  Well,<br/>
lots of ways.  Maybe your laptop or computer has a built in microphone<br/>
already.  If not, you might need a mic.  As Orion said, you can get<br/>
one that plugs directly into your computer using USB.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you might have an mp3 player or iPod that can record, or do as<br/>
orion does and has an add-on to record.  There are high end digital<br/>
recorders too.  Maybe you have a MiniDisc recorder, that can work to.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if you have none of these, a quick and dirty way is to go to<br/>
www.gabcast.com and set up a free account.  You can call a free phone<br/>
number and record yourself.  It will create a digital file for you. <br/>
The sound quality sounds like you are on a phone, but you will have<br/>
something!<br/>
<br/>
Then the next step is taking that file and cleaning and editing it up<br/>
a bit in an audio editing program like Garageband, or Audacity (which<br/>
is a freeware program online for PC and Mac's).  If this part<br/>
indimidates you, give the file to me and I'll work on it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Then we post away!  I'll do that. So, if you have an idea, run with it<br/>
and we'll figure out a way to use it.  Let me know what you do and<br/>
don't have and I'll try to help however I can.<br/>
