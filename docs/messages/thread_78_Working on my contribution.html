Well, I guess you could email each of them and get permission, but<br>
maybe this group was pretty big!  Maybe you don't really know all of<br>
them (I wouldn't at a big gathering).<br>
<br>
Maybe you could ask the host/hostess of the event to send out an email<br>
to all the sign-ups and let them know that you were recording for this<br>
project, and if anyone who was present and would object, to contact you.<br>
<br>
If they are just in the background noise, I don't think you have to<br>
got through that.  As far as identifying each of the speakers, I don't<br>
think you have to do that if it is obviously a group give and take<br>
conversation.<br>
<br>
My 2 cents.<br>

I think the pieces that I'm going to use won't be a problem because those particular boxers <br>
knew about the iPod. I want to use snippets of the background stuff as part of my intro, so <br>
that shouldn't be a problem either. Sampling, as it were... I can't wait to get into <br>
GarageBand with this stuff!<br>

I also want to sit down with the WildCats. They have some good tales :-) <br>

What I have is a device called a Micro Memo that just pops on to the bottom of my iPod. It <br>
then sets up my iPod to record digitally. I can record anywhere with the Micro Memo, so I <br>
like that. Then I just hook my iPod into the computer and it will download the recordings <br>
there. Once in the computer, I play around in GarageBand (a Mac program-there's others <br>
you can download for the PC). That's the fun part! You can also buy a USB mic that <br>
connects into your computer and record that way. The key is to record something digitally <br>
and put it into a program.<br>
<br>
   I'll look around on the internet and try to post some good podcasting tutorials. The <br>
more people contributing will make for more interesting podcasts. Go for it!<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>

No worries, gone are the days of popping in a cassette and hitting<br>
record...didnt' we take that for granted!<br>
<br>
Yeah, its more complicated now, but its not that much harder.  First<br>
check out this new page I started to see if it helps..<br>
http://letterpod.podbean.com/podcasting-basics/<br>
<br>
Like Orion said, basically you are now recording digitally, instead of<br>
to a tape.  The sound is converted to a digital file, which when<br>
played back sounds like sound.  So how do you record digitally.  Well,<br>
lots of ways.  Maybe your laptop or computer has a built in microphone<br>
already.  If not, you might need a mic.  As Orion said, you can get<br>
one that plugs directly into your computer using USB.<br>
<br>
Or, you might have an mp3 player or iPod that can record, or do as<br>
orion does and has an add-on to record.  There are high end digital<br>
recorders too.  Maybe you have a MiniDisc recorder, that can work to.<br>
<br>
Or, if you have none of these, a quick and dirty way is to go to<br>
www.gabcast.com and set up a free account.  You can call a free phone<br>
number and record yourself.  It will create a digital file for you. <br>
The sound quality sounds like you are on a phone, but you will have<br>
something!<br>
<br>
Then the next step is taking that file and cleaning and editing it up<br>
a bit in an audio editing program like Garageband, or Audacity (which<br>
is a freeware program online for PC and Mac's).  If this part<br>
indimidates you, give the file to me and I'll work on it for you.<br>
<br>
Then we post away!  I'll do that. So, if you have an idea, run with it<br>
and we'll figure out a way to use it.  Let me know what you do and<br>
don't have and I'll try to help however I can.<br>
