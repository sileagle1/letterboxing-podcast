all understand.<br>
<br>
September was a wash because of the academic year beginning at the<br>
college where I work.<br>
<br>
October was a wash because I went to Fright Night and was working on<br>
the video for that.<br>
<br>
November was a wash because of carving for my muggle stamp carving<br>
business and Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
December is looking a bit better, but not for a few weeks.  I have<br>
multiple obligations over the next couple weekends, and just can't<br>
find a break to compile the last episode.  <br>
<br>
If anyone has anything, I can still take it.  I have some great<br>
material from Lundy, and Dear Crabby.  If anyone has something else, I<br>
WILL accept it ...Sprite, Mark, anyone.  But you have a couple weeks<br>
to compile if you need it.  My new deadline is Christmas (but not a<br>
Christmas episode this year...not enough time.)<br>
<br>
So anyway, sorry for the long delay.  I am also still working on a<br>
bloopers reel for FN4, and the 14th Body story by DEF and OldHounder.<br>
