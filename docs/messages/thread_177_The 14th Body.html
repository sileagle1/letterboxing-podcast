<br>
The 14th Body is a reality.<br>
<br>
Long time fans of the Letterpod will remember messages on this here<br>
group from Dale End Farm hinting at a story she had to share.  This<br>
was back at least in October of 2006, maybe sooner.  She even<br>
references it in the first Fright Night video.  Talk about a two year<br>
teaser!  <br>
<br>
Well, I was privileged to record both DEF and Oldhounder as they<br>
shared this story to me at FN4 in 2008.  I finally got around to<br>
editing the footage, and getting it posted on the Letterpod site.<br>
<br>
I remember when I just got started in doing this and thinking that<br>
this story was a big mystery.  Well, its real now.<br>

I've been waiting to hear this story as well. I know Dale End Farm wanted Old Hounder with <br>
her when it was finally told and I'm glad she waited.<br>
Off to listen...<br>
<br>
Thanks, Jackbear.<br>
