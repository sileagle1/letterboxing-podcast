but I was looking at the stats page for the Letterpod<br>
(http://letterpod.podbean.com) and found some interesting things.<br>
<br>
We had no listeners since I started using podbean in the states of<br>
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, New Mexico, or Oklahoma.<br>
 This seems to be supported by the lack of posts on those states AQ<br>
boards.  However, I know OK has got letterboxers...you got a<br>
patch...don't you!  Just kiddin' OK, I know you are out there...hope<br>
you'll give us a listen.<br>
<br>
We have had listeners in Great Britan, Sweden, Netherlands, Japan,<br>
Korea, and Mexico.<br>

Those poor states with not even one listener!<br>
Can you tell us where the most hits are from?<br>
That would be interesting as well.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm looking at a google map with lots of pin points on it, so<br>
its harder to say without a lot of counting.<br>
<br>
No surprise, listeners follow population. There are several listeners<br>
in California, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and around the<br>
major cities..DC, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Atlanta, etc.<br>
<br>
It's like looking at that picture of the country at night...all the<br>
lights are east of the Mississippi, and then in California...with<br>
black areas out west.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of pin<br>
points in the west, but its big country...so they get spread out.<br>
<br>
Just noticed Mississippi hasn't had a listener either!  <br>
<br>
Anyway...just curiosities..<br>
