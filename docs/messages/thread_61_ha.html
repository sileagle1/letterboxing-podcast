*laugh* I told Amanda I thought you sounded like you were in your late<br/>
teens or early twenties and sounded VERY sexy. What'd you do with the<br/>
real Music Woman? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Not that you aren't sexy in your own way, of course. Err... Okay....<br/>
that doesn't sound good.... but you know what I mean! Face-to-face, I<br/>
don't remember you sounding so young, but it's been awhile since I<br/>
last heard your voice so maybe I don't remember it so well. It seemed<br/>
to me like you were talking faster than normal, though, which might<br/>
have had something to do with it. All perky or something. =)<br/>
<br/>
Not really a bad thing, though. ;o) It was a lot of fun listening to<br/>
you, and was very engaging as well. *nodding*<br/>

&gt; teens or early twenties and sounded VERY sexy. What'd you do with the<br/>
&gt; real Music Woman? ;o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not that you aren't sexy in your own way, of course. Err... Okay....<br/>
&gt; that doesn't sound good.... but you know what I mean! Face-to-face, I<br/>
&gt; don't remember you sounding so young, but it's been awhile since I<br/>
&gt; last heard your voice so maybe I don't remember it so well. It seemed<br/>
&gt; to me like you were talking faster than normal, though, which might<br/>
&gt; have had something to do with it. All perky or something. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not really a bad thing, though. ;o) It was a lot of fun listening to<br/>
&gt; you, and was very engaging as well. *nodding*<br/>
