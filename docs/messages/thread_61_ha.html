I was horrified the first time I heard my own voice. It takes a big<br>
person to hear themselves. If I ever make it onto the podcast, I'm not<br>
sure I'll ever listen to it myself. =)<br>

*laugh* I told Amanda I thought you sounded like you were in your late<br>
teens or early twenties and sounded VERY sexy. What'd you do with the<br>
real Music Woman? ;o)<br>
<br>
Not that you aren't sexy in your own way, of course. Err... Okay....<br>
that doesn't sound good.... but you know what I mean! Face-to-face, I<br>
don't remember you sounding so young, but it's been awhile since I<br>
last heard your voice so maybe I don't remember it so well. It seemed<br>
to me like you were talking faster than normal, though, which might<br>
have had something to do with it. All perky or something. =)<br>
<br>
Not really a bad thing, though. ;o) It was a lot of fun listening to<br>
you, and was very engaging as well. *nodding*<br>
