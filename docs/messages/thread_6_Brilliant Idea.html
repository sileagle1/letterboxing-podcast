                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks so much for including me in this fun endeavor. I've been downloading podcasts <br>
from NPR, Studio 360, LOST, knitting groups and lots of other cool places. I appreciate the <br>
fact that I can custom design my IPod listening (and watching!) or catch a story I may have <br>
missed. It's about time for a letterboxing podcast!<br>
<br>
I'm a toatal neophyte when it comes to the technology. That's what's got me excited- I <br>
really want to learn the how to's of podcasting. That, plus the fact that letterboxing is <br>
pretty unlimited when it comes to material. Interviews would be a natural.<br>
<br>
John, I think your introduction script is spot on and the perfect place to start. Once a <br>
month sounds good, too- keep people wanting more! Plus I'm sure there's a bit of work <br>
involved. <br>
<br>
You can count on me to:<br>
1) write stories<br>
2) learn and assist in technical matters<br>
3) bring enthuiasm<br>
<br>
Also, my husband, Ron, has access to some pretty state of the art video equipment <br>
through his job should you want to video tape in the future.<br>
<br>
Can't wait to help out anyway I can.<br>
<br>
 Just think, like the video Mark has of the first gathering in Vermont, this will record  <br>
letterboxing history for future generations!<br>
<br>
Take care, Kathie/Orion   <br>
