                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the next week or so, I will be announcing the sale of a Letterpod CD compilation.<br/>
<br/>
This 4 CD set will have episodes 1-14 of the Letterpod, sent in a lovely dust jacket that summarizes each episode.<br/>
<br/>
The price will be listed at $15 which includes shipping.  Proceeds will go to Letterpod hosting fees.  They will be posted for sale on the Letterpod website.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to give our fans here a heads up in case you want a set, or know someone with dial-up or who may want this collection in a hard copy.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep you posted.<br/>
