in.<br/>

The future ideas sound great. Of course what will be <br/>
really fun will be interviews. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that Brian would be interested in recording <br/>
an article on carving? That would be great if he would.<br/>

&gt; I like this a lot! Great job, John.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only change I would humbly suggest is in the last <br/>
&gt;line of the second to last paragraph. "..contact the <br/>
&gt;owner." Should you explain how to do that? And maybe <br/>
&gt;expand on the idea that box creators love to receive <br/>
&gt;status reports, even if a few words, about their boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also - future Podcast ideas: What to do with a HH, <br/>
&gt;Letterboxing Terms &amp; Initials, Attend a Gathering and Put <br/>
&gt;a Name with a Stamp, Talklists, Many Ways to Play the <br/>
&gt;Game, History of Letterboxing in the US, etc. Those <br/>
&gt;aren't meant to be actual titles - just suggestions of <br/>
&gt;other topics.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know you mentioned stamp carving - would you interview <br/>
&gt;Brian or use some of his techniques? Maybe he might want <br/>
&gt;to write something that you could edit?<br/>
