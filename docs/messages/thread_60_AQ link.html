I'm just glad the podcast finally gave me an excuse to rewrite that<br/>
whole headline gathering code. Originally Choi was going to hand-write<br/>
the RSS feed using a format that my code didn't support (but I've<br/>
wanted it to support for a long time for my own purposes--the Great<br/>
Adventures). But the code was a mess from the old days of PHP4. I had<br/>
to completely rewrite that headline gathering code from scratch and<br/>
it's SOOO much nicer. Cleaner, less prone to bugs, and easily<br/>
extendable for other headline formats.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, then Choi dumps that hand-writing of XML files and uses his<br/>
blog instead--which happened to be the same format that the old code<br/>
already supported.<br/>
<br/>
But all's well--I've wanted to fix that code for a long, long time,<br/>
and now I can put my Great Adventures into the headline mix as well. =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Take care, Orion  (or O'Ryan as someone at the Ithaca Gathering<br/>
&gt; cleverly said ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And don't think I thought someone was calling for me on several<br/>
occasions so I'd turn my head, "Huh?!" Oh, it's just you....  ;o)<br/>
