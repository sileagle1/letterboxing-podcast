I was just sitting down to write a few more and saw that all Twelve Days are done. Wow-<br>
I had only written one down and it was 10 inky fingers, so great minds do think alike!<br>
<br>
Who likes to sing?! <br>
I have a friend who plays and teaches piano and has a beautiful voice. I could twist her <br>
arm...<br>
We may just have a songbird among us as well.<br>
I'm telling you, those micro memo recorders are amazing :-)<br>
<br>
I really like the collaberation effort. We need to do it more often.<br>

I just have a desire to get something other than a partridge in that old tree!<br>

Now, I'm happy :-)<br>

Perhaps instead of it being sung in its entirety (it is a long song) <br>
just the last of it could be sung with a different person doing each day <br>
and it being edited together like the Top Five List was done.<br>
