It was super easy. <br>

Lockwench, I want to thank you publicly for your donation!  Eventually<br>
I hope not really to have to ask, and maybe we'll get enough from the<br>
sale of patches.  But for now, its the Public Radio format, where we<br>
are supported by the listeners.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
Ha, maybe I should do the NPR type spot at the end of each episode,<br>
"Support for Letterpod comes from listeners like you..."<br>

                    <html><body><p>The Blue Diamond patches sold EXTREMELY well. I sold nearly 200 in less than 3 weeks!   But I really believe that they sold so well because they filled a vacuum caused by there being no Atlasquest patch. Sales have slowed down quite a bit, but I always get a spike in orders at events when people actually SEE the patch. It came out really well and is quite attractive. <br/><br/>And you are right, patches NEVER go bad. You can save by ordering many, and you can also save by making the patch slightly smaller ( like a 1/2 inch less in either direction).  I personally feel there are enough variations on the LBNA logo so I  am not sure I will buy another ( all mounted on a backpack, they look all the same), but I like to support the site so I will probably buy whatever you make!<br/><br/>LW PhD<br/>"Nice Counts"<br/><br/><br/></p><p>
