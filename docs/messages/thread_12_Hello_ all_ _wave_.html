stamps!" It would be great to get something creative into <br/>
the podcast.<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather have a .com as well, but I don't think the <br/>
domain is very important.<br/>
<br/>
Unless we can find something to add, the first episode is <br/>
going to be pretty dull stuff with just the background <br/>
info on how to get started letterboxing. We really need to <br/>
get interviews and clues to a podcast letterbox to get <br/>
things going but that can be in the second episode. I may <br/>
actually need to split it into two parts to keep the size <br/>
manageble but I'll see how big it is.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to get the first episode out in June then <br/>
monthly after that.<br/>
