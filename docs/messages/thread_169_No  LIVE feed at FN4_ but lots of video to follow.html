I did shoot lots of video, so I will be editing this over the next two<br>
weeks, and will have something out before thanksgiving.  Thanks to<br>
everyone at the even who helped, and special thanks to Conrad for<br>
trying to get the Live feed going to the best of his abilities.<br>
<br>
I hope I can make a video that lives up to Editron and Orion's<br>
previous works.<br>
