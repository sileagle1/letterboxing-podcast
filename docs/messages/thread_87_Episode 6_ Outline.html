My all consuming project should be out of here this weekend. Then I'll put my section <br>
together and get to you by the middle of next week. I normally have more free time but <br>
this book was the exception.<br>
<br>
This is going to sound so professional- I can't wait.<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>
