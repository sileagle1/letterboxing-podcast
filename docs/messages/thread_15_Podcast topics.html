                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay- so after rereading both Ryan and Mark's adventures to Dartmoor, I nominate that <br/>
they both read the narratives of their trips for a future podcast. John or someone else  <br/>
could give a brief history of letterboxing and then the blog entries. The adventures are <br/>
beautifully written and many folks probably haven't found them yet (their loss!). Plus it <br/>
would be cool to hear the stories read in Mark and Ryan's own voices.<br/>
<br/>
This is just what I'd consider a natural next step after an introduction. The history of <br/>
letterboxing is actually part of the introduction. It should be a two part podcast because it  <br/>
then needs to follow up with the US history of boxing. The US history would then lead to <br/>
everything else. That would definitely fill up some podcast recording time!<br/>
