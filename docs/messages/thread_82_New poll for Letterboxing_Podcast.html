Should the Letterpd sell a CD compilation of the first ten episodes? (some people say they haven't listend to the letterpod because they only have "dial-up." <br>
<br>
  o Yes, sell them at cost (CD+Shipping and Handling) <br>
  o Yes, sell them slightly above cost with profit going to Letterpod for hosting fees <br>
  o No, this is not a good idea, don't bother. <br>
  o No, good idea, but just give them away to the few people who want them. <br>

<br>
If you have enough people who want to buy them, to make it worth the<br>
effort etc... then yes, make them and charge a bit more to go towards<br>
the costs/time of making Letterpod.  But if you only have a handful of<br>
people who are interested, I'd just give them away.  (as opposed to<br>
not bothering at all)<br>
<br>
So, perhaps, a good poll would be If there were a cd of the first 10<br>
letterpods, would you buy one?<br>
<br>
And, it should be asked on all the major boxing groups, not just on<br>
this group since there (hopefully) are many who listen to pod but are<br>
not on this group.  <br>

Wish I had a new episode for you to listen to while you heal!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input.<br>
<br>
I did a little research.  I would have to have Episodes 1-5 on Disc 1,<br>
and 6-9 on Disc 2.  Running time of a CD-R is 80 min.  They have<br>
higher volume CD-Rs, but they are not reliable on all CD media (i.e.<br>
might not work in your CD player.)<br>
<br>
With postage ($.41 + $.17 for sqare envelope) + CD + envelope...looks<br>
like cost would be around $1 total.  <br>
<br>
Just reference for everyone.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would highly recommend that you mail each CD in a plastic jewel <br>
case, then put it in a padded envelope. It is possible to get jewel <br>
cases that will hold 2 CDs at a time.  <br>
<br>
I mail CDs all the time, and if you don't double protect them, they <br>
WILL break in transit.  It costs a little more up front for the <br>
supplies and the additional postage, but they will arrive unbroken.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One more thought.  If you do end up selling cds, on the order form, or<br>
whatever you use, have a place for people to put their Donation<br>
amount.... basically, you could charge "actual" cost... $1 or<br>
whatever, but most people, I THINK!, will feel guilty about only<br>
paying that much.  So be sure to have a place for them to "up" the<br>
amount they pay if they want to.  I think a lot of people would be<br>
very happy to pay $5 (for example) if you charge $1.  <br>
<br>
I go to a Recycle for Education place that charges .30/lb for the<br>
stuff they have (really GREAT donated stuff that is good for office<br>
supplies and art projects).  But when you check out and the guy says<br>
you owe $2 for the 3 stuffed grocery bags of goodies you are buying,<br>
he words it "That's $2 or whatever you'd like to donate".  <br>

                    <html><body><p>Just my thoughts:  If these are given away free then I wonder who IS going to end up paying for the CDs, padded envelope &amp; postage?  Someone has to pay for this.  I don't think it's right to expect jackbear to cover the costs.  There's no way to know if the demand will be small, medium or large.  Even though I've heard all of the podcasts, I may enjoy having one myself, as may other podcast members.  <br/><br/>Letterboxers who aren't part of the podcast group may also be interested.  We could list that they are available on the AQ Patch &amp; Paraphenelia group possibly.  They may even bring in new interest into the group.  Patches, etc. aren't free so why should these be?<br/><br/>I like the idea of making these available on CD.  As more podcasts are recorded more CD choices could be made available.  Example:  CD #1 - Podcasts  1-5.  CD #2 - Podcasts 6-10.  CD #3 - Podcasts 11-15.
