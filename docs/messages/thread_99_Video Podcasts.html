A podcast can be anything really.  A voice over really isn't<br/>
necessary, or music.  Those things are fairly easy to add if you have<br/>
the right software, but by all means...if you have some letterboxing<br/>
footage, I would totally take it.  I don't have much experience with<br/>
video editing, but I have the software on my MAC, and could give it a<br/>
shot, at least putting a title screen on it or something.   <br/>
<br/>
Technically speaking POD means "Play on Demand", so your video without<br/>
voice over and music can be a podcast if it is given an RSS feed<br/>
(which is what we do here at letterpod...hahaa)<br/>

&gt; I just wanted to get some clarification. . .does a video have to have  <br/>
&gt; a narrative to be considered a podcast? If someone just shot a video  <br/>
&gt; with no voiceover or music, is that just a video? What about a video  <br/>
&gt; with just music?  Or would all these be podcasts?<br/>
