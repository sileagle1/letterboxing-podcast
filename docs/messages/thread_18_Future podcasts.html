<br/>
   I know this is an evolving process, but how do you see future podcasts happening? <br/>
Would we individually create pieces and then submit them to you to add to the monthly <br/>
podcast? I know there's technical concerns and you would prefer a continuity to the whole <br/>
piece. Any and all help is definitely appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion/Kathie<br/>

Yes, I'd like to receive individual contributions and edit them into a<br/>
complete podcast. I can receive them in .wav or .mp3.<br/>
