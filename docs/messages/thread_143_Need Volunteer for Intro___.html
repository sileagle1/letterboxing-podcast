we we need:<br>
<br>
Each episode of the podcast begins with "Hi, this is (trailname) from<br>
(place) and your listening to the Letterpod." This is a way to give a<br>
shout-out to your hometown and boxers who might know you, or who<br>
don't, but always wondered what you sounded like! You can record an<br>
intro by calling a free recording service, called Gabcast. We have our<br>
own area we can record to, and all you need is a telephone! First,<br>
email jackbear and let him know you want the password to record an<br>
intro for Letterpod. Then call 1-800-749-0632. Enter the Letterpod<br>
channel number which is 11349 #. Then you enter the password and then<br>
hit #. Then the voice prompts will tell you to press 1 to record a<br>
message. At the tone, record your intro and hit # when you are done.<br>
You can listen to it back, and change it if you goofed up. The message<br>
gets automatically saved, and it will be available to use in a future<br>
episode. Its easy!  Just talk clearly and slowly enough that we can<br>
hear you well.<br>
