<br/>
I thoruoghly enjoyed Music Woman's adventures in Dartmoor. Especially the trip through <br/>
the marsh with the cows as company :-)  It painted a very vivid mental picture! The photos <br/>
were a terrific bonus.<br/>
<br/>
I also liked the talk with Lazy Letterboxer. The story about the ubber letterboxers on 5 <br/>
mile hikes uphill made me laugh. It certainly explains Lazy's name. I'd have been sitting <br/>
right next to her at Sleeping Giant! She's the most actice letterboxer I know. Anyone that <br/>
could put together the Pink Flamingo Gather has my undying admiration.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to go after the mysterious audio clue box but I need to listen to that a few more <br/>
times...<br/>
<br/>
So. I'm anxious to hear #3 and I'm thinking about future contributions. This is such a fun <br/>
project.<br/>
<br/>
On a technical note, does anyone know when the micromemo voice recorder is coming out <br/>
for the video IPod? Turns out nothing works on 5th generation yet. The microphone device <br/>
needs to plug into the docking connector, not the ear plug. The 5G ipods are supposed to <br/>
have CD quality recording ability, which is so cool. So come on 3rd party developers- get <br/>
the mics on the shelves!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, orion<br/>
