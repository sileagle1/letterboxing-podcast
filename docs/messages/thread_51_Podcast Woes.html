Well.<br/>
<br/>
I have to be the first to admit that I had my letterboxing birthday <br/>
party, and it was a pretty good success.<br/>
Only one thing-I forgot completely to do the podcast!<br/>
Comepletely.<br/>
Didn't even think about it for days!!<br/>
<br/>
There is one good thing: I had planned for 30, and only got 12 or so, so <br/>
I have lots of the mini fannypack, compass, blocks etc. so I was <br/>
thinking to have a youth group letterboxing meet<br/>
with the kids at my church. Vacation Bible school has just finished, <br/>
(and I was one of the leaders....) Exhausted! They might like to have a <br/>
reunion later in the summer.<br/>
I would leave the boxes where they are for now. Only some of the kids <br/>
came to the birthday, and no one got all the boxes. I might add one or <br/>
two more.<br/>
<br/>
So there is still time!<br/>
I haven't gone through and patched my wav files together to convert to <br/>
MP3 for my Brues Woods narrative. I may get to do that this week.<br/>
