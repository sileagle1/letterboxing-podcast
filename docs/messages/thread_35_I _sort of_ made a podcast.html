It is an interpretive trail, nicely maintained, with 6 numbered posts.<br>
I came there at dusk, so the birds were trilling.<br>
My idea was to record while I was planting. I had the brochure, so I  <br>
was reading the interpretive comments as I went.<br>
<br>
The main problem was that this device records in .wav which I know is  <br>
convertible to MP3, but is a very bulky format. I didn't have enough  <br>
memory to finish the whole thing at once. I am getting a 1G miniSD on  <br>
Wednesday, so I think I am going to redo it. My clues include the  <br>
interpretive trail, as you enter at station 1 and find the boxes after  <br>
station six.<br>
I think it would be nice to offer as an alternative to carrying around  <br>
a map and brochure on the clue page, by reading the interpretive trail  <br>
markers, and then the clues, as I am going, but it will be better the  <br>
second time (I hadn't even been there before last Friday).<br>
