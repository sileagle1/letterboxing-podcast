For those of you that aren't familiar with letterboxing, let me take a<br>
few minutes to give you an overview and explain how you can get<br>
started letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing is an intriguing "treasure hunt" style outdoor activity.<br>
Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly-accessible<br>
places and place clues to finding the boxes online on one of several<br>
websites like letterboxing.org and Atlas Quest. However, clues to<br>
finding some of the most highly-sought boxes are passed around by word<br>
of mouth. There are about 20,000 letterboxes hidden in North America<br>
alone. <br>
<br>
Individual letterboxes usually contain a log book, an often<br>
hand-carved rubber stamp and may contain an ink pad. Finders make an<br>
imprint of the letterbox's stamp in their personal log book, and leave<br>
an imprint of their personal stamp on the letterbox's logbook <br>
<br>
Letterboxing is said to have started in England in 1854 when a<br>
Dartmoor National Park guide, James Perrott of Chagford, left a bottle<br>
by Cranmere Pool with his calling card in it an an invitation to those<br>
who found the bottle to add theirs. Eventually, visitors began leaving<br>
a self-addressed post card or note in the jar, hoping for them to be<br>
returned by mail by the next visitor (thus the origin of the term<br>
"letterboxing;" in case you don't know "letterbox" is a British term<br>
for a mailbox). This practice ended in time, however, and the current<br>
custom of using rubber stamps and visitor's log books came into use.<br>
It caught on in the US in 1998 after an article in Smithsonian<br>
magazine. See also: A Short History of Letterboxing. <br>
<br>
To get started, you'll need a "trail name," rubber stamp, pencil or<br>
pen, small sketch book, one or more ink pads or brush markers, and,<br>
optionally, a simple compass. <br>
<br>
A trail name is your letterboxing identity. Some letterboxers chose to<br>
use their real name, but most chose a trail name that means something<br>
special to them. Examples of trail names are Mark & Sue, The Drew<br>
Clan, Team Green Dragon, Silent Doug, Clueless, and (my own) Choi. <br>
<br>
The image for the rubber stamp should mean something personal to you<br>
or your family and is either hand-carved or commercially made. This is<br>
your "personal stamp" and you'll use this to make an imprint in the<br>
log book contained in each letterbox that you find. If you letterbox<br>
as a family, you can either use one team stamp or a stamp for each<br>
person. <br>
<br>
The pencil or pen is used to add your trail name and date next to your<br>
personal stamp imprint that you've made in the log book. You might<br>
also want to add a personal comment about your experience finding the<br>
letterbox.<br>
<br>
The sketch book is your "personal log book" where you stamp imprints<br>
using the stamps in the letterboxes that you find. It's best to use<br>
acid-free heavy weight paper. Paper with a smooth finish gives the<br>
best impression. An alternative is to make an imprint from the<br>
letterbox stamp on plain paper then later cut it out and add it to a<br>
scrapbook.<br>
<br>
At a minimum, you should carry one inkpad or brush marker to ink up<br>
the stamp to make your imprints. The easiest type to use has a raised<br>
foam pad. ColorBox pigment ink pads are an excellent choice. The<br>
letterboxes that you find will sometimes contain an ink pad, but many<br>
do not. If you find that you enjoy letterboxing, you may want to<br>
purchase a set of 24 Marvy Brush Markers. Their large brush point and<br>
bright, non-toxic, odorless watercolor make them perfect for rubber<br>
stamping because the color stays wet longer than other markers. No,<br>
this isn't a paid advertisement for Marvy Brush Markers I just really<br>
like these pens.<br>
<br>
Although many letterboxes don't require it, you should consider<br>
purchasing a simple baseplate compass that costs about $12. You won't<br>
need a fancier compass, since nearly all letterbox clues that<br>
reference simple compass barings based on magnetic North. <br>
<br>
Now that you're fully equipped, you need to locate some clues to<br>
letterboxes near you. The primary web site for letterboxing clues is<br>
www.letterboxing.org. Another popular web site is www.atlasquest.com.<br>
Once you find the clues to a letterbox that you'd like to find, read<br>
it carefully and try to locate and print out a trail map of the area<br>
in which you'll be hiking. <br>
<br>
The most important things to remember when letterboxing are respect<br>
and safety respect for the environment and for the letterbox that<br>
someone has created and your personal safety. <br>
<br>
Letterboxing is intended to be an environmentally friendly activity,<br>
with as little impact as possible on the environment involved in<br>
hunting for letterboxes. Letterboxes should always be hidden in<br>
publicly-accessible areas, yet out of sight of casual visitors. Do not<br>
disturb any historical landmark or private property. Do not dig,<br>
remove native vegetation, disturb natural rock formations, or<br>
interfere with animals or their habitats. Leave the location better<br>
than you find it; you are encouraged to remove any litter left behind<br>
by people who care less for the land than you.<br>
<br>
Respect the contents of each letterbox and the effort put into it by<br>
the letterboxer who made it. Letterboxes usually only cost about $5 or<br>
$10 to make but the letterboxer who created it also put a lot of time<br>
an effort into creating and placing the letterbox. <br>
<br>
There are hazards of letterboxing, such as poison ivy and creatures<br>
like snakes or spiders who tend to like the same crevices and cavities<br>
where letterboxes are often hidden. It's usually best to use a stick<br>
to poke into crevices then reach in carefully for the letterbox. Also<br>
be sure to letterbox with a partner or let others know where you are<br>
going. Carrying a cell phone is also a good idea, although some<br>
letterboxes are located in areas without cellular service. Most<br>
importantly, use common sense to letterbox safely. <br>
<br>
When you arrive at the location of the letterbox by following the<br>
clues, make sure that there aren't others around when you go to<br>
retrieve it to prevent it's location from being discovered by<br>
non-letterboxers who might not respect the letterbox. Be careful not<br>
to damage any plants or historical structures in your search for the<br>
box. Actual digging should never be required, but you usually have to<br>
look under rocks, sticks or leaves to find the letterbox. <br>
<br>
Once you've retrieved the letterbox, move a bit away from the hiding<br>
spot before opening it. If someone comes along and asks what you're<br>
doing, be creative!<br>
<br>
Sometimes you'll search for the letterbox and not be able to find it.<br>
It could either be missing or simply difficult to find. Although this<br>
can sometimes be frustrating, just remember the great time you've had<br>
with the hike and the hunt, even if you don't find the letterbox. <br>
<br>
The letterbox container will typically be some type of plastic food<br>
storage container, although many types can be used, as long as they're<br>
watertight. Some containers are very small, such as a film canister,<br>
or may be disguised as a rock or some other natural feature. <br>
<br>
Inside the letterbox you'll find a log book and rubber stamp. You may<br>
also find an ink pad and pen or pencil. Stamp the imprint of your<br>
personal stamp into the letterbox's log book and write in any<br>
information that you'd like. Next, stamp the imprint of the<br>
letterbox's stamp in your personal log book. You might also add the<br>
name of the letterbox, who created it, and the date that you found it.<br>
Some people also like to add a little note about their experience into<br>
their personal log book.<br>
<br>
Once you've finished "stamping up," be sure to seal any plastic bags<br>
and the letterbox container itself carefully and replace it as you<br>
would hope to find it: completely hidden from view, with contents<br>
protected from the elements. Water is the biggest threat to<br>
letterboxes. If a letterbox is found damaged, please notify its owner.<br>
<br>
We'll talk about how you can plant your own letterbox in a future<br>
Letterboxing Podcast, but in the meantime I hope that you find<br>
letterboxing as fun and addicting as I do. Happy hunting!<br>

<div>I like this a lot! Great job, John.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The only change I would humbly suggest is in the last line of the second to last paragraph. "..contact the owner." Should you explain how to do that? And maybe expand on the idea that box creators love to receive status reports, even if a few words, about their boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also - future Podcast ideas: What to do with a HH, Letterboxing Terms &amp; Initials, Attend a Gathering and Put a Name with a Stamp, Talklists, Many Ways to Play the Game, History of Letterboxing in the US, etc. Those aren't meant to be actual titles - just suggestions of other topics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know you mentioned stamp carving - would you interview Brian or use some of his techniques? Maybe he might want to write something that you could edit?</div>
