Choi wants to pass the baton on, I'm willing to pick it up.<br>
<br>
I've talked a little to Orion and Lockwench offline and they are<br>
interesting in putting some content together.  I'll compile it as we<br>
need, and get it posted somewhere.  Right now I'm looking at some<br>
differnt hosts, first on my list is www.podbean.com.  We can start for<br>
free, and then pay in once we get rolling.  They have lots of features<br>
that might work for us, like having multiple contributers, and estore<br>
options (so we can sell a patch or something to offset the fees).<br>
<br>
For the time being, lets maybe shoot for a seasonal timeframe.  A<br>
summer episode, fall...etc.<br>
<br>
Orion has a plan for a great segment (hope I'm not letting the cat out<br>
of the bag here) for "Tales from the Trail".  These would be stories<br>
from letterboxers about things they have encountered on the trail. <br>
Lockwench also has a great idea about trying to get some clues on the<br>
podcast, and I couldn't agree more.  This might draw in some people<br>
who wouldn't otherwise listen.<br>
<br>
More to come...pipe in of you have an idea or want to record something<br>
for the next episode.  <br>

    Next time were all at a gathering together, I'll record that story for you. I'm quite <br>
intrigued.<br>

Take care, Orion<br>
