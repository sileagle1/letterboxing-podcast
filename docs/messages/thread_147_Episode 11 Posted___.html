<div>If anyone has any thoughts about submitting something but is a little tentative because of how awkward they think they sound, I can attest that jackbear is a wizard at making you sound better.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That was nice of you to say Lundy.  Which brings up a great point...<br>
yes..do submit!  Submit anything really.  Keep in mind, I don't<br>
consider this "my" show.  I couldn't do it without all the people who<br>
donate there time and efforts to send in ideas, comments, recordings,<br>
stories, etc.  This has always been a group effort.  <br>
<br>
To Lundy's credit, I didn't clean it up THAT much!  For an unscripted<br>
segment, I was impressed.  I usually end up recording all my segments<br>
multiple times, and I'm usually reading off a sheet of paper!<br>
<br>
I've been getting some great feedback so far on this episode, and lots<br>
have already logged in the Stumper.  This is the part I get to sit<br>
back and just enjoy in the fun.<br>
