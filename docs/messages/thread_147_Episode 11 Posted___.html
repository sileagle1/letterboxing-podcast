yes..do submit!  Submit anything really.  Keep in mind, I don't<br/>
consider this "my" show.  I couldn't do it without all the people who<br/>
donate there time and efforts to send in ideas, comments, recordings,<br/>
stories, etc.  This has always been a group effort.  <br/>
<br/>
To Lundy's credit, I didn't clean it up THAT much!  For an unscripted<br/>
segment, I was impressed.  I usually end up recording all my segments<br/>
multiple times, and I'm usually reading off a sheet of paper!<br/>
<br/>
I've been getting some great feedback so far on this episode, and lots<br/>
have already logged in the Stumper.  This is the part I get to sit<br/>
back and just enjoy in the fun.<br/>

&gt; I'd like to say that episode 11 is AWESOME!  Good job, you guys!!!  I<br/>
&gt; especially love the "Dear Crabby," segment.  Crabby knows her stuff!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; That was nice of you to say Lundy.  Which brings up a great point...<br/>
&gt; &gt; yes..do submit!  Submit anything really.  Keep in mind, I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; consider this "my" show.  I couldn't do it without all the people who<br/>
&gt; &gt; donate there time and efforts to send in ideas, comments, recordings,<br/>
&gt; &gt; stories, etc.  This has always been a group effort.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To Lundy's credit, I didn't clean it up THAT much!  For an unscripted<br/>
&gt; &gt; segment, I was impressed.  I usually end up recording all my segments<br/>
&gt; &gt; multiple times, and I'm usually reading off a sheet of paper!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've been getting some great feedback so far on this episode, and lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; have already logged in the Stumper.  This is the part I get to sit<br/>
&gt; &gt; back and just enjoy in the fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What a great job you did cleaning up all my mess ups!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone has any thoughts about submitting something but is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little tentative because of how awkward they think they sound, I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; attest that jackbear is a wizard at making you sound better. Regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Stampeaz Stumper segment,?Mark and Sue sounded great, but my<br/>
&gt; &gt; part?was very awkward. When I listened to it, I was very pleased at<br/>
&gt; &gt; how much he cleaned it up and made it a good segment.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well done jackbear!<br/>
