                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  This was a full episode.  It turned out to be 41 minutes long! <br>
The longest yet.  I actually like to keep it at 30 minutes or less,<br>
but this one just had a ton of material!  I actually had to learn how<br>
to FTP a file to the podbean website! hahaha<br>
<br>
If you look at all the people who were involved in this episode in the<br>
show notes, you can see why it took so long!  Ha...actually it was<br>
because I was lazy for two months...heehee.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hope you all like this one.  Thanks to everyone for all the help.<br>
<br>
I would like to start the idea of "themes" now.  Anyone have a theme<br>
idea for an episode to be released in May (I hope).<br>

I can't wait to head to the site to take a listen.<br>
<br>
As far as themes go- how about the 10 year anniversary of letterboxing? <br>
I'm planning on going to BABE at the end of this month and I'll record a Southern take on <br>
our hobby. I believe they're planning on having the Max Patch box there, which is one of <br>
the very first (maybe even the first?) letterboxes planted in the US. I can't wait to get that <br>
stamp :-)<br>
<br>
Also, the arrival of Spring and how we in the NE never think it'll come- it mostly does. I <br>
say this as it's snowing again on the day before April Fool's Day!<br>
<br>
Oh, April Fool stories would be good even if they're a month late...<br>
<br>
Off to listen to #10!<br>

I like the idea...something.."historic"....topics around our history,<br>

Maybe Anniversary Diversity...a look at regional differences and<br>

<br>
Podcast #10 was excellent!<br>
 <br>
Of course, my friend Ann's rendition of My Favorite Things with those fabulous lyrics was <br>
a highlight for me. She made stepping in dog feces sound like fun!<br>
<br>
Mama Cache answered ALL my questions about LTCs. It was one of those defining <br>
moments when all the pieces fall into place. It was a great interview. <br>
<br>
Dear Crabby gave her usual insightful comments as only a crusty crab can :-)<br>
Then the Stampeaz Stumper is a fun addition and I'm afraid Phynstar's riddle definitely has <br>
me stumped...<br>
<br>
Finally, how does Watsamatta U do that?! It's amazing to hear all those words strung <br>
together and delivered so rapidly. It boggles my mind!<br>
<br>
Another fun episode Jack Bear-Thanks!<br>
<br>
Orion***<br>
P.S. An overseas interview would be great to hear...<br>
