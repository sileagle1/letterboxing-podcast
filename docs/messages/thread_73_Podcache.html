That was a very interesting podcast.The more geocachers and letterboxers understand <br>
each other, the better I say. I didn't know that Anderson Cooper went letterboxing on the <br>
air-wish I'd seen that. The podcasters thought a lamp post letterbox would be a cruel fate <br>
but gave me ideas...lol<br>
<br>
I enjoyed their "on the trail" recording. That's something that intrigues me. With my new <br>
IPod digital recorder, that's my next goal. Maybe boxing in Andover with the Wildcats <br>
would make for an interesting podcast :-)<br>
<br>
I do believe that the name or clues for anyone else's specific box has to be kept secret. <br>
Maybe I could plant my first audio clues letterbox...hmmm. I better get carving!<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion <br>
