Rick-in-Boca lamented the lack of boxes planted in New Jersey for <br/>
Plant a Letterbox Day, so I'm planting quite a number of Mystery <br/>
boxes this week.  They'll be up by this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I like Mystery boxes (I only have one plant that isn't one) because <br/>
they tend to be lower traffic, and will likely stay there longer than <br/>
those boxes which lead you right to them.<br/>
<br/>
I also like creating puzzles for others to figure out.  I used to <br/>
play Dungeons and Dragons quite a bit in high school and college, and <br/>
I found that I liked being the Dungeon Master more than actually <br/>
playing the game.  I think I liked the power trip of being in charge <br/>
of the situation.  Maybe that's why I have almost an equal number of <br/>
plants and finds (soon to be plants &gt; finds).  I planted my first box <br/>
before I found my first.  Rick was, incidentally, the first (and <br/>
only, so far) finder of my first plant, "Heartbeat Road".<br/>

&gt; OK, since no other ideas have popped up, let's go with a "Mystery"<br/>
&gt; type theme for Episode 12.  So let the ideas roll.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let's shoot for a 4th of July time frame.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks everyone!<br/>
