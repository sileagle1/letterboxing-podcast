<br>
As for Episode 7, please tell me if you have anything to submit.<br>
So far I have a "Top 5" (like letterman's top ten but I'm too lazy to<br>
do ten), a letterboxing song sung by Balloon Fanatic's family, and<br>
very soon an interview with Lundy (totally ran out of time on Saturday<br>
when I had him right in front of me...just ran out of time..sorry<br>
Lundy...I'll get you on the phone).  I think Orion will have another<br>
Tale from the Trail, am I right?<br>
<br>
Let me know if anyone has anything else.  Will be looking for a<br>
September release I think.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I definitely have another Tales from the Trails. Muddy Paw's Excellent Adventure. It's all <br>
done except for a small intro, which is recorded and just needs to be inserted into the <br>
track. Should be heading out end of this week or begining of next. In other words, around <br>
Labor Day :-)<br>
<br>
Happy Labor Day all!<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>
