 I guess I just have been lazy (well, not really, I have been working<br/>
on some plants lately) about getting the next episode out.  I was<br/>
thinkng about a Leap Year theme, but that didn't seem to generate a<br/>
lot of interest, so our next holiday is St. Patricks Day I suppose<br/>
(drat...we missed groundhog's day didn't we!).  There is also the Ides<br/>
of March (15th of March) and Easter...all in the course of like<br/>
three/four days!  Any ideas for a theme?  Anyone anyone...bueller...<br/>

 St. Patrick's Day and Easter probably lends itself to more ideas.<br/>

<br/>
I have some teasers for you...<br/>
-I am in negotiations with someone about an interview regarding the<br/>
new craze...LTCs!<br/>
-I am also in negotiations with someone about a sponsorship for<br/>
Letterpod that may include contests and prizes...maybe...we'll see<br/>
what we come up with.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a request into the "Live and Breathe" Committee to see if<br/>
we can record something at that event to share with the letterboxing<br/>
community who can't attend.  I would love to see some video out of<br/>
this event, maybe something like what Ron has done with Fright Night.<br/>
 I could edit if someone was going an could shoot footage.  Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea in my head is sponsoring a virtual debate of our<br/>
"presidential candidates."  I can set up a conference call and<br/>
moderate the debate, and record the conversation.  Thought that would<br/>
be fun to listen to.  This would not be for next episode for sure.<br/>
<br/>
That's what's going on here.  Anyone else have a project in the works?<br/>

Covering the LTC angle would definitely get a lot of attention. I'm still on the learning <br/>
curve there and would like more insight myself. I know we have people here on the <br/>
podcast group that are pretty knowledgeable on that subject :-)<br/>

You're on the case, JackBear-thanks!<br/>
