Perhaps we should each take a day and see what we come up with. I'm sure we could get <br>
12 people. Or just keep posting suggestions and let JackBear choose. After all, he intially <br>
put out the call for ideas :-)<br>
<br>
 I agree about the song not being long because too much time equals mega megabytes in <br>
the podcast world, so editing is important. Maybe we should just start at the 12th day and <br>
work to number 1 like Cyclonic said. As far as 12 different people singing, the logistics <br>
would need to be worked out but that could work. I'm going to see my  friend tonight and <br>
I'll see if she'd be interested in singing, if we go that route. She's a professional singer, so <br>
it would really sound good.<br>
<br>
Maybe we could "adapt" another holiday song as well. Any ideas?<br>
I like the idea of making the Christmas podcast fun and a bit different. I have a twist on my <br>
Tales From the Trails. I just thought of it today and I'm pretty excited about it :-)<br>

<div>Folks,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This reply got posted to the board but I'm not sure it got distributed. At 
least I didn't get a copy of it so I am posting it again. I apologize for the 
duplicate post if everyone already got it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think this might be the letterbox version of "Twas the 
Night Before Christmas" that I was thinking about. I will write to the author to 
see if it is ok to use. I'll also see if he would like to record it 
for us or if he would rather someone else did.</div>
