It was wonderful and I'd planned on finally getting an interview with Dixie. Alas, I somehow <br/>
managed to break my microphone before that happened...darn!<br/>
<br/>
I did get to tape a very good story from Eidilon and Artemis as well as Flory Family and <br/>
Suduko Crazy. Also, I plan on retelling my adventures at the NC gathering, so that should <br/>
help represent the 10th anniversary of letterboxing. The gathering was on the exact date <br/>
of the planting of the Max Patch box, perhaps the very first letterbox in the US. It was <br/>
really cool being there for that!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion***<br/>
P.S. I'll get started soon, getting everything into Garageband.<br/>
