How long can a person record via the phone? <br/>
This would certainly be a great way for people that don't have the means to digitally record <br/>
segments to get a podcast contribution recorded.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really looking forward to the Christmas podcast, especially the Twelve Days of Christmas.<br/>

Gabfest...that would be the North Carolina board on AQ;-) at<br/>

Yes, the recordings don't come out at the quality of a microphone and<br/>
a computer can give you, but it works for things like this when you<br/>
have lots of people participating.  It's totally free too, which ain't<br/>
bad.  This is how I have people record an intro for the letterpod if<br/>
they have no other means.<br/>
<br/>
I also use something called the Gizmo Project to call people and<br/>
record, this works well if you have to have two people interacting.  I<br/>
can also do conference calling through that as well.  If you are<br/>
interested its at http://www.gizmoproject.com<br/>
<br/>
OK....let's get recording...we have 11 days left!<br/>
