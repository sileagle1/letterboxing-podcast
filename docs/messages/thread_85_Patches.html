                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for this info LW!  Looks like a great site, she obviously has<br>
lots of experience in this field.  I wonder how many patches we can<br>
realisticly sell?  How have your Diamond patches been selling<br>
Lockwench?  We don't have the listeners yet that I expect we will<br>
have, but I don't think I would hesitate to order a hundred.  They<br>
don't spoil, and I really think the patches are getting more popular,<br>
not less.  I know I've already had a couple people asking me about<br>
them (because of the patch logo on the site).<br>
<br>
Can't wait to see your design Lockwench! <br>

> I have the Letterpod design done but it needs lettering and cleaning<br>
up. As for a patch, I have another cool site that I order patches<br>
from..and the beauty of it is she lets you order MUCH smaller<br>
quantities than www.patchesrus. I used her site for the merit badges (<br>
which just came in, btw, and they are GORGEOUS!) because I needed many<br>
separate amounts of badges for each of the levels for plants and<br>
finds. Her stuff is really beautiful and I have several of her<br>
hiking/outdoor themed patches. Just tell her I sent you!<br>

> If you just want to get a quote from her regarding a small quantity<br>
of the LBpod patches, she could probably let you order only 25 or 50. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I totally understand why you wouldn't by another patch that looked<br>
like all the other patches...that makes sense.<br>
<br>
Some folks buy all the patches, some don't.  For instance, I don't buy<br>
patches unless I've been there, or am a member of that group.  Its<br>
more of a souvenir for me.  But there are a number of regional patches<br>
out there with the spin on the LBNA patch.<br>
<br>
I think what you're working on is way more original, and I'm hoping it<br>
will meet the approval of others on this list as a patch.  <br>
<br>
Anyway....I'm off thinking about patches and donations...we got to get<br>
Episode 6 out...right?  Won't sell patches or get donations unless we<br>
have a show!<br>
