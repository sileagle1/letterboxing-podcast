were wondering why I was not responding.<br>
<br>
Keep those creative juices flowing though, the Mystery episode should<br>
be a lot of fun.  <br>
<br>
I've got ideas pegged down for the Stampeaz Stumper and my interview.<br>
 I know Orion has stuff recorded already for the Tales from the Trails.<br>
<br>
-We could use a etiquette/mystery question for Dear Crabby.<br>
<br>
-We could use someone to record the intro (anyone from Mystery, AK?)<br>
<br>
-We could use a mystery clue or two.<br>
<br>
-anything else you think would be fun!<br>
<br>
See you later...<br>
