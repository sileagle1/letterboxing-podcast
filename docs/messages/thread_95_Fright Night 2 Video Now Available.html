<br>
  I don't remember watching this before!  Thanks to lundy for the CD.<br>
 Who created this video?  Choi's old post on it said it was Ron.  I'm<br>
sorry I don't know who Ron is...can someone help me out so I can give<br>
credit to the right person for this very cool piece of letterboxing<br>
history.  I think it really helps show people what a gathering looks<br>
like, or at least a themed gathering.<br>
<br>
It takes a few minutes for it to cue up, even on broadband<br>
connections, but once it does, its ready to go.  I opened here at work<br>
which has amazing speed and it took about 40-60 seconds...so be patient.<br>
<br>
I am willing to accept more such videos and have created a category<br>
for them on the website.<br>

Ron Jones to be exact!<br>
Ron is a very talented artist who's turned his attention to making small movies. I twisted <br>
his arm and got him to film the Fright Night 2 podcast.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Lundy and you, Jack Bear, for getting the video on the podcast site.<br>
Ron will be thrilled that others are getting to see it again :-)<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>

Orion, and thanks to Ron for this treasure.  It really is very good<br>
and hope it will inspire others to follow suit.<br>
