  I don't remember watching this before!  Thanks to lundy for the CD.<br/>
 Who created this video?  Choi's old post on it said it was Ron.  I'm<br/>
sorry I don't know who Ron is...can someone help me out so I can give<br/>
credit to the right person for this very cool piece of letterboxing<br/>
history.  I think it really helps show people what a gathering looks<br/>
like, or at least a themed gathering.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a few minutes for it to cue up, even on broadband<br/>
connections, but once it does, its ready to go.  I opened here at work<br/>
which has amazing speed and it took about 40-60 seconds...so be patient.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to accept more such videos and have created a category<br/>
for them on the website.<br/>

Ron Jones to be exact!<br/>
Ron is a very talented artist who's turned his attention to making small movies. I twisted <br/>
his arm and got him to film the Fright Night 2 podcast.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lundy and you, Jack Bear, for getting the video on the podcast site.<br/>
Ron will be thrilled that others are getting to see it again :-)<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
