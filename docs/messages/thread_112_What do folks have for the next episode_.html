The morning after FN3 we were sitting around swapping boxing stories
with Kitten and Celtic Quinn . Their story about boxing in "20 foot"
snow banks during the Desperately Seeking Sun event was hilarious. I
kept wishing we had a recorder sitting on the table because it would
have made a great podcast. So now I'm thinking some snow boxing stories
might be great addition to the podcast especially in the upcoming
winter months. Unfortunately, the Paws aren't tech-savy enough at this
point to contribute material, but we're quite happy to share this idea
in hopes that someone else might want to run with it.<br/>

So, I've arranged to record my brother/Large Marge this weekend about our Cape Cod <br>

Muddy Paws, you have a great voice for "radio", you should go for it. JackBear can even do <br>
his magic on the raw stuff ( I think....). <br>
More audio!!!!<br>

Take care, Orion<br>
P.S. Ron's working on the video and hopefully will make headway this weekend.<br>

Orion...I know you won't let me down!  Thanks!<br>
<br>
I'll try to come up with some filler, and I will probably be able to<br>
get Dixie next week, or if that doesn't work out, I'll get somebody<br>
else and get Dixie for the next one.<br>
<br>
Here's some other ideas I have been thinking about:<br>
-Dear Abby type column (this Abby will talk about letterboxing<br>
etiquette)(I need questions, and someone willing to be "Abby")<br>
-Letterboxing Panel/Round Table... basically a recorded conferance<br>
call of multiple letterboxers.(need a topic and letterboxers)<br>
<br>
- On the video end...I would like to see some "tutorial" like videos.<br>
