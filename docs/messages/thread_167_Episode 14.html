All submissions for the Ep. 14 to be by October 17th with a release<br>
date set from October 19th or 20th.<br>
<br>
No theme per see.  So far I have a song from Wassa (and another<br>
masterpiece one at that!)<br>
<br>
Mark, I would love to hear all about live an breathe and your trip to<br>
OR.  I think that would be awesome if you have the time.<br>
<br>
Orion, sounds like you have some great stories....go for it!<br>
<br>
I think with L&B wrap-up, and upcoming Frightnights, and all that, I<br>
don't think I can keep it organized in one theme, so lets do a big old<br>
potpourri of Letterboxing stuff.<br>
<br>
What do you all think?<br>
