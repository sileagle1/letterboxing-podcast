 the questions asked were great to get a cool variety of answers.  And<br>
of course we want to see all those costumes.  Looks like a real fun<br>
event.  There is a ton of editing, and Ron really did a great job<br>
getting realy interesting highlights.  Thanks.  Keep those videos coming.<br>
<br>
If you are inspired by Ron's work, keep in mind I'm looking for more<br>
gathering videos, letterboxing tutorial videos, audio or video clues,<br>
and anything else you've got.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to have the next audio episode up before the big Turkey<br>
Day.  Stay tuned!<br>

<br>
Ron did a great job - and I helped (remember those old Shake and Bake commercials?)!<br>
Ron is a wiz with the video and he enjoys making movies.<br>
He was just given the trail name of Editron by wattsamatta u and it's going to stick. We've <br>
been trying to get something to stick for awhile and nothing seemed right. The FN3 video <br>
definitely had some side benefits!<br>
<br>
I can't wait to hear the next audo podcast :-)<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion***<br>
