 Audio clues are fantastic, especially when a pirate sings them to you. This is another <br/>
outlet for future podcasters. It saves paper, too!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

Thanks you two!  You are always like the first to listen to anything<br/>
that goes up...its great to have fans out there...thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Sahalie: Re: Patch.  I designed that as a logo for the podcast, with<br/>
an intent to produce it as a patch and sell them on the site to offset<br/>
the hosting charges.  I may still do this, but I'm waiting to see what<br/>
Lockwench comes up with.  She is working on a really cool design for<br/>
the site, so I want to wait to see if that would make a better patch.<br/>
 I know she is really busy though with moving plans, so I just need to<br/>
wait a little while, but yes, a patch is in the works.<br/>
<br/>
Orion: Yes, I wanted to do an audio clue as an example of what people<br/>
can do.  On Atlas Quest, I also linked to the audio clue for people<br/>
who wanted to listen to the clue<br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=24647.<br/>
<br/>
Now I don't think I can do this on Atlas Quest yet, would have to ask<br/>
Ryan, but on LBNA, I can directly embed a player into the clue to so<br/>
you can stream right off of that page:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=27623&amp;boxname=Pirate%20of%20the%20Genesee<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool huh?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for listening...now go record a clue, so I'm not the only<br/>
 schmoo sounding dumb with a clue! hahaha.<br/>

I seem to remember a box placed in CT called The Music Box (I think...) that had song clips <br/>
as clues. That always stuck in my head. <br/>
<br/>
The Pirate of Genesee will definitely stick in my head. Jackbear, you have the perfect radio <br/>
voice. Thanks for sharing!<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to be done with my present project by Monday or Tuesday. After which, my <br/>
first order of business is to put together Tales from the Trails. It'll have a letterboxing <br/>
camping theme :-)<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to see the Lpod patch. Lockwench was going to show me a sketch at Ithacca <br/>
but I got sidetracked and remembered about it after the event was over. My loss. That's a <br/>
patch I want to own, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Well, back to the drawing board. Or at this stage, the painting board!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

&gt; LOVE LOVE LOVE it, John!  You must have had such fun singing that<br/>
song! I have a letterboxing song ready to go but just need to find<br/>
guitar accompaniment. I'll let you know when I have it done!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to hear that!  Mine would have been a lot better with a<br/>
guitar!  You know, I had to record each verse and then stop so I<br/>
didn't cough up a lung!  But other then that...it was really easy as<br/>
pie.  The water and seagull soundeffect came right from the Garageband<br/>
library...so simple.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; About this donation to the site...how do I do that again? I would<br/>
like to make a paypal donation.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to http://letterpod.podbean.com and look on the left hand<br/>
side of the screen, you see a "Tip Jar".  Put in the amount you would<br/>
like ($5 covers a month of hosting fees at our current level) and hit<br/>
donate..it will take your right to a Paypal page...easy easy.<br/>

As for a patch, I have another cool site that I order patches from..and the beauty of it is she lets you order MUCH smaller quantities than www.patchesrus. I used her site for the merit badges ( which just came in, btw, and they are GORGEOUS!) because I needed many separate amounts of badges for each of the levels for plants and finds. Her stuff is really beautiful and I have several of her hiking/outdoor themed patches. Just tell her I sent you!<br/><br/>If you just want to get a quote from her regarding a small quantity of the LBpod patches, she could probably let you order only 25 or 50. <br/><br/>Here's the info:<br/><br/></p><pre><tt><tt>Lori <span id="lw_1184301844_2">St. Martin</span><br/>e-patches &amp; crests<br/>Box 3081<br/><span id="lw_1184301844_3">Spruce Grove, AB  T7X 3A4</span><br/><span id="lw_1184301844_4">780.960-4825</span> phone<br/><span id="lw_1184301844_5">780.962-2962</span> fax<br/><span id="lw_1184301844_6">lori@e-patchesandcrests.com</span><br/><a href="http://www.e-patchesandcrests.com/" target="_blank"><span id="lw_1184301844_7">http://www.e-patchesandcrests.com</span></a></tt></tt></pre><br/><p>
