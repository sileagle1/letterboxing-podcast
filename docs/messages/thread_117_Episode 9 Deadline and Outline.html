I would also like to get together another interview.<br>

Noooo!  Don't do it!<br>
<br>
Really, I mean it, and I'm trying to be constructive here, but that <br>
whole segment just plain stunk.  First off, you could not understand <br>
half of what she was trying to say, and secondly she came off very <br>
pretentious.  The question answered was also poor.  It was just plain <br>
bad radio.<br>
<br>
For an advice segment, first you have to have a better question to <br>
answer.  The question should never be what can someone do to make <br>
someone else do something, but rather what can I do to make something <br>
work better.  Real clear, right?  You want to be able to give advice <br>
that can be acted on immediately.<br>
<br>
The person giving the advice should do so in a clear and concise <br>
manner.  They should never sound as if they are putting anyone down, but <br>
rather be soothing, easy to understand, and calm.<br>
<br>
This is easily my biggest gripe about Ep. 8.<br>

Keep working on Dixie.  Another suggestion for an interview that I think <br>
you might find interesting may be Lightnin' Bug here in PA.<br>

Keep at what you are doing.  You sound great as host, much more upbeat, <br>
easily relatable.  I really enjoy it.  Like some of the music too, <br>
specifically the intro music.  Some of the elevator sax bumpers could go <br>
though.  Keep it lively, you don't want to put people to sleep.<br>

I am sorry, I did not realize that writing constructive criticism would <br>
be so irritating to you.  Maybe it would be best if you simply blocked <br>
my email right now, because I am not going to gush over everything.  I <br>
think it better to comment on both the good and bad, as that is the only <br>
way you improve.<br>
