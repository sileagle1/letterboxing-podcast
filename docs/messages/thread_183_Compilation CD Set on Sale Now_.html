                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Letterpod (the Letterboxing Podcast) is now excited to announce the sale of a 4 CD set of Episodes 1-14 of the Letterpod.  The set includes the original five episodes hosted by Choi, the famous "Holiday Spectacular" and much more! These complete audio episodes are available for $15.00 (shipping INCLUDED) at:<br>
http://letterpod.podbean.com/compilation-cd-set/<br>
<br>
All proceeds go to keeping the Letterpod web hosting fees paid up.<br>
<br>
This is a great opportunity for those who may have dial-up, slow loading speeds, or other technical problems that have prevented them from listening online, or for those who want hard copies to play in the car, or other media.<br>
<br>
I also have fewer than 15 patches left, if you would like an embroidered Letterpod patch, now is the time to order.  This design will not be re-ordered.<br>
