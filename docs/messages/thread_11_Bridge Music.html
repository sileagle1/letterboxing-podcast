&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;motto is "we're not evil"! They <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seem to support podcasters, so this looks like a a <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;good <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bet. <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My husband plays guitar so he could record some of his <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;own stuff, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't want the FBI knocking on our doors!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Take care, Orion/Kathie<br/>

for sound loops and <br/>

something that might work. <br/>
&gt; What date are you looking for as the launch of the first podcast? <br/>

<br/>
 I'm fortunate to have two very talented brothers, especially when it comes to technical <br/>
stuff. I just got back from one brother's house who helped me make my first metal <br/>
sculpture using a plasma cutter and welding equipment. That was so cool!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to hear the first pocast.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Kathie<br/>
