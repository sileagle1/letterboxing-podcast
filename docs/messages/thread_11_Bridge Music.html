It probably shouldn't be anything that is copyright protected. Check <br>
out this company, though:<br>
http://magnatune.com/<br>
Under "Why we are not evil", it says "Podcast-legal: podcasters can <br>
obtain and use our music for free."<br>

<br>
 I'm fortunate to have two very talented brothers, especially when it comes to technical <br>
stuff. I just got back from one brother's house who helped me make my first metal <br>
sculpture using a plasma cutter and welding equipment. That was so cool!<br>
<br>
Can't wait to hear the first pocast.<br>
<br>
Take care, Kathie<br>
