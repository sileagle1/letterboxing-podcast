to a geocaching podcast (maybe I shouldn't say there name even if I<br/>
remember it right...hahaha) and they liked a segment on it where a<br/>
bunch of geocachers recorded their conference call where they<br/>
discussed various topics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have the ability to do this, for almost free.  I say almost because<br/>
the people who called in would have normal phone rates as it is not<br/>
toll free, but we have no set up fees.  I can basically do this<br/>
through the Gizmo Project I keep talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I think this would be neat to try at some point.  <br/>
<br/>
What I want to know, is I would like some suggestions on what<br/>
should/would the group talk about?  What are some questions or topics<br/>
that you think would work well in this kind of format?<br/>
