                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm very excited to announce a design competition for a new Letterpod patch.  With the old patches are almost gone, I would like to launch the new design at this year's LB CON 2009.<br>
<br>
The Prize: The winning designer will win 1) the final patch they design 2) the 4 CD compilation of Episodes 1-14 3) and will be interviewed for an upcoming episode of the Letterpod.  Cool enough?<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
- All designs must be submitted to jackbear by midnight of May 25th, 2009<br>
- designs should be submitted in .jpg or .pdf form please.<br>
- patch design should not exceed 3x3 inches.<br>
- designs should include the colors "purple and green" but are not limited to only these colors<br>
- designs should include a pair of headphones, but are not limited to only headphones.<br>
<br>
Design Selection:<br>
Design submissions will be posted online, and voted upon by the letterboxing community.  The design with the highest number of votes after a week will be the winning patch design!  Patches will then be ordered, and launched at LB CON 2009.<br>
<br>
Contact me with any questions!<br>
Thanks and good luck!<br>
