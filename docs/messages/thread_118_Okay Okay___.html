My hopes in going forward with the Ms. Crabby segment was to better<br/>
letterboxing.  Using it as an educational piece to help letterboxers<br/>
come to terms with topics on etiquitte, fairness, and treating each<br/>
other in a nicer way.  However, the critique of this segment has led<br/>

We all have feelings, and they are easy to hurt on these public<br/>
boards.  I'm certainly not trying to make enemies with this podcast,<br/>

says something "stunk".  I also respect the right of that person to<br/>

I'm sorry Cyclonic and others did not like the piece.  It's his right<br/>

On the First day of Christmas my true love gave to me a carved piece of art in a <br/>tupperware box.<br/><br/>Okay folks, got eleven more?!<br/><br/>Take care, Orion***<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:Letterboxing_Podcast@yahoogroups.com">

<br/>&gt; not want to act as a censor to this group.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; That said, I won't approve any more messages in regards to the Dear<br/>&gt; Crabby segment in Episode 8.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My hopes in going forward with the Ms. Crabby segment was to better
<br/>&gt; letterboxing. Using it as an educational
 piece to help letterboxers<br/>&gt; come to terms with topics on etiquitte, fairness, and treating each<br/>&gt; other in a nicer way. However, the critique of this segment has led<br/>&gt; to exactly what I don't want to see happen.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We all have feelings, and they are easy to hurt on these public<br/>&gt; boards. I'm certainly not trying to make enemies with this podcast,<br/>&gt; and I don't want to start. Yes, it ruffles my feathers when someone
<br/>&gt; says something "stunk". I also respect the right of that person to<br/>&gt; say it though.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I'm sorry Cyclonic and others did not like the piece. It's his right<br/>&gt; to think that. Archimedes Screw has every right also to have her
<br/>&gt; feathers ruffled, as I was, when she read the post and responded.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As one of the moderators, I will use "moderation" and call for a cease<br/>&gt; fire, and move along to other topics.<br/>
