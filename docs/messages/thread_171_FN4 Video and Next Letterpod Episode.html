include the video and the next letterpod audio episode.<br/>
<br/>
The video is coming along, it just takes time to get it all right, and<br/>
try to get the audio right.  It won't be out this week I'm sure.<br/>
<br/>
For the next letterpod episode, I just don't have enough material yet.<br/>
 I have a Dear Crabby, and a song from Wassa.  I could use at least<br/>
one more thing to make a short episode.  I think Orion and Mark had<br/>
some ideas.  Anyone?  Oh, I thought of an easy Stumper for next time,<br/>
so I guess I have that one for this time anyway.  PLEASE HELP if you can.<br/>

It'll be bare bones, so you can add music if you like.<br/>
