                    <div class="plaintext-content">... I can hear it being tweeked in Ron's studio! <br/>
I actually sat down and watched what he has so far.<br/>
So far, so good!<br/>
<br/>
In order to keep the file from being massive, we're trying to keep it under 5 minutes. There <br/>
will be a fair amount of editing but the overall effect's great. I think Ron will have this ready <br/>
real soon :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I really want to urge folks to record their boxing stories and send them to either Jack <br/>
Bear or me for the Tales From the Trails portion of the podcast. Basically, I need stories but <br/>
don't have to record them "live". The Tales from the Trails intro can be followed by me saying <br/>
"here's the story of _______ about the time they ___________. Help me fill in the blanks!<br/>
Right now, I'm twisting Eidilon's arm to record one that involves boxing and what they <br/>
discovered and brought home :-)<br/>
<br/>
So buy digital recorders and share the fun!!! <br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
