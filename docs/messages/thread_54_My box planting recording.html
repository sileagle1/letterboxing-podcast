<br/>
Did you get my box planting recording?<br/>
I finally heard from oldhounder and he did, and liked it.<br/>
It is for a kind of tribute box to them, so if you need more than  what <br/>
I have recorded, then let me know.<br/>
I could record an intro too, but I sound so funny to myself!<br/>
<br/>
Also, do you want me to convert to MP3 from wav or would you rather have <br/>
the raw recording.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if this is not what you had in mind, please don't feel obligated <br/>
to use it.<br/>
I plan on recording clues as opposed to writing them down, because I <br/>
will have my smartphone with me and it is easier that trying to write <br/>
down everything.<br/>

I had typed up clues for the Stone Chapel one, and have put it on my blog<br/>
http://www.dalendfarm.blogspot.com/ but not put it on the sites yet.<br/>
I hadn't written clues for Big Kahuna and Slow Mouse yet. That is an  <br/>
"homage" box for Oldhounder and Siamese, and I sent them the clues and  <br/>
the raw podcast, and they have already found them.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I should just do the podcasts for clues? Or write clues, too.<br/>
