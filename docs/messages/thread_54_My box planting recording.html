<br>
Did you get my box planting recording?<br>
I finally heard from oldhounder and he did, and liked it.<br>
It is for a kind of tribute box to them, so if you need more than  what <br>
I have recorded, then let me know.<br>
I could record an intro too, but I sound so funny to myself!<br>
<br>
Also, do you want me to convert to MP3 from wav or would you rather have <br>
the raw recording.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if this is not what you had in mind, please don't feel obligated <br>
to use it.<br>
I plan on recording clues as opposed to writing them down, because I <br>
will have my smartphone with me and it is easier that trying to write <br>
down everything.<br>

I had typed up clues for the Stone Chapel one, and have put it on my blog<br>
http://www.dalendfarm.blogspot.com/ but not put it on the sites yet.<br>
I hadn't written clues for Big Kahuna and Slow Mouse yet. That is an  <br>
"homage" box for Oldhounder and Siamese, and I sent them the clues and  <br>
the raw podcast, and they have already found them.<br>
<br>
Do you think I should just do the podcasts for clues? Or write clues, too.<br>
