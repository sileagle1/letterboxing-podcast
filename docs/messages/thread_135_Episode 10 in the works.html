                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, record the Dear Crabby segment this morning, and have the intro<br>
ready to go from the RIFamily.  I have an interview in the works about<br>
LTCs with Mama Cache, hopefully we'll get this done in the next week<br>
or so.  I've got positive feedback so far for the Stampeaz Stumper,<br>
and I have someone helping out with the first "stumper."  Wassamata_U<br>
has written a theme song for it, can't wait to hear it.  We also have<br>
another song parody in the works, which I will leave as a surprise for<br>
you all.  I know Orion has a Tale from the Trail in the works, so<br>
looks like we have a full episode.  Hope to have it out in a few weeks.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone on your input about CD's.  Its an idea I got thinking<br>
about after talking to some people at gatherings who have said they<br>
haven't heard it, mostly because they have dial up.  Though so far<br>
others have seem more interested then this group!<br>
<br>
OK, so I like the chatter here...keep it up!<br>

I am waiting on a couple of things that I need to complete the<br>
episode, which revolve around the Stampeaz Stumper.  We need to work<br>
out a few things then I should be able to finish up the episode.<br>
<br>
However, I am leaving for New Orleans on Thursday, and have a lot to<br>
do before then, so I am not optimistic Letterpod will get done as I<br>
had hoped.  Therefor, it will be at least until after Easter until I<br>
can get it together.  My apologies for the delay...but stay tuned...it<br>
will be done soon!<br>

had lots of fun adventures, and I managed to get three boxes<br>
planted...very urban boxes.  I hope they last, lots of foot traffic in<br>
the area.<br>

Anyway, will be working on episode 10 this weekend, so should be done<br>
soon...thanks for your patience.<br>
