                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK everybody, I said I would like to have the next podcast ready<br>
around the 4th of July.  That's about a week and a half away!  Ahhh!<br>
<br>
So, if you can have anything you are working on into me by July 1,<br>
that would be terrific.<br>
<br>
Remember the theme is Mysteries.<br>
<br>
I will have a stumper.<br>
I will have an interview.<br>
I will have a Dear Crabby.<br>
<br>
Orion, got a Tales from the Trail?<br>
<br>
I need someone to do the intro.  You can even pretend to be someone<br>
your not...it is a mystery episode after all!<br>
<br>
I will have Episode 13 to follow in July.  This one will have a<br>
"Gathering" theme, because I am expecting some reports from the<br>
Letterboxing Cruise, as well as some upcoming news and info about big<br>
events coming up.  So start thinking about that as well.<br>
