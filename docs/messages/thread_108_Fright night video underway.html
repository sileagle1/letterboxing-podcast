Ron's going to try real hard to get the film created in time for the November submission <br/>
deadline. Thanks to Sapphireberry, Wood Sprite, Cooties, Mainekokopellian, Lundy (and any <br/>
other Letterpod members I'm forgetting) for telling your Tales of Horror!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. I can't wait to get my Letterpod patch.<br/>

<br/>
You guys did a great job at FN3 both with setting up the videopod <br/>
area, and with twisting people's arms to tell their tales! LOL There <br/>
was so much going on that dragging folks away I know was a difficult <br/>
task for you!<br/>
<br/>
Those bonus stamps were expertly carved and a terrific gift, thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to another creative videopod!<br/>

I know that it's hard to get people in front of the camera, so we appreciate it when <br/>
someone sits down. You'll notice that I've never been filmed for one!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ron's already started and is well under way. He did manage to get a nasty cold and is busy <br/>
at work but I know how he works and it's going to bug him having the film hanging out <br/>
there without getting it done, so it'll shape up fast.<br/>
<br/>
The stamps were fun to carve and you'll notice the generous use of black space as to have <br/>
less rubber to carve :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to seeing the final product myself. Thanks for the appreciation!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. I'm joining the "I just got my patch and love it" club. Jackbear, you are good!<br/>
