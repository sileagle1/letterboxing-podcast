                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know this isn't letterbox related IPod news, but my local library consortium started a <br>
downloadable audio books program yesterday. I haven't used it yet but thought it was <br>
another great use of the IPod.<br>
<br>
This may interest Choi and others, who's libraries are part of the Merrimack Valley Library <br>
Consortium (www.mvlc.com). I guess you download the free software program and then <br>
you get to download books on CD. Seems to be a pretty good selection. Another great <br>
selling point for owning these awesome video/audio companions!<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion/Kathie<br>
P.S. This will definitely not stop me from visiting one of my favorite places-the library!<br>
