                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well,<br>
<br>
I am not sure this whole topic is on topic here, but so far this isn't  <br>
a large volume list, so I will reply to Kathie :) Let me know if you  <br>
are interested or not in this as a podcast topic for a future podcast.<br>
<br>
I have two sons at home still age 6 and 9, and I am having their  <br>
birthday party together. I have about 11 acres of conservation  <br>
restricted land, and I abut the Great Meadows refuge and the Sudbury  <br>
Valley Trustees (who have a box on their property next to me) I have  <br>
invited about 30 kids, in both age groups, and mentioned that any  <br>
adult that wants to stay is welcome. I have carved and hidden 5 boxes,  <br>
which are planned to be planted in the wild after the party.<br>
They are identical to my regular boxes except that I didn't put the  <br>
ink and stamp in a bag for now.<br>
<br>
First I am going to have them make a stamp. I got the blocks from  <br>
Letterbox Adventures, and I got foamie stickers from Michaels. Their  <br>
goodie bag is a fanny pack, from Oriental trading, and it will have a  <br>
log, compass and ink (not washable because that was too expensive)  <br>
They are instructed to wear long pants and play clothes.<br>
<br>
Each box is hidden out of site of the others, so no one will see them  <br>
being opened. I plan to divide them into 5 groups, age appropriate,  <br>
and send each group out with an adult. I may or may not have one set  <br>
of clues for each age group. I have a picture clue already for one of  <br>
the boxes. I was also planning some decoding, and perhaps clues hidden  <br>
along the way. I have some landmarks planted as well (one of those  <br>
tree faces, chimes, a dog's grave)<br>
<br>
I was going to wait until all groups were back before sending them all  <br>
out again. If the older ones were done really early, I could send them  <br>
to the Wol-box next door, or even my King Philip's Wood ones at the  <br>
end of the street.<br>
<br>
I have posted the boxes on Atlasquest so that they can log their  <br>
finds, and I will give them a business card, with the urls. I am  <br>
hoping some of them will continue after the party!<br>
<br>
I was going to have a cookout, but I may not because it is from 1-5 ish.<br>
<br>
That was all I had so far-any suggestions welcome, and please if you  <br>
don't want to hear any more of this onlist, I can reply off<br>
<br>

PS Thanks for the stamp compliment :) It is my 4th since April  <br>
Vacation, as I got better carving :)<br>

You might want to stress the learning aspect of teaching <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great party- lucky kids! I like the idea of recording events such as a letterboxing <br>
birthday party so this begs the question, how is this technically done? I get the mic and <br>
headphone connected to the computer concept but what about field recordings? A lot of <br>
letterboxing podcasts that I'm thinking about might involve away from the computer stuff. <br>
A prime example would be at an event.<br>
<br>
So John-help!<br>
<br>
Also what do we need to know about recording large groups, permission wise? I would <br>
imagine any small converations would need the other person's/people's permission. But a <br>
large group, for background atmosphere, how does that work?<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>
P.S. I just sent a script via the e-mail. Please let me know if you didn't receive it. Thanks!<br>

I really like the idea of the digital voice recorder. It's a good way to build up a library of <br>
material. I'm extensively going to visit my in laws this weekend who just happen to live <br>
near Ithaca. Which just happens to be the Finger Lakes gathering weekend. No small <br>
coincidence!<br>
  I'd like to record some of the fun as Celtic Quinn trys to plant some 24+ cooties on folks. <br>
I need to buy a recorder by tomorrow, so thanks John for the links. I have a Mac, so am I <br>
going to be limited with my choices? I hope not.<br>

Take care, Kathie<br>
P.S. Mark and Sue- see you on Saturday!<br>
