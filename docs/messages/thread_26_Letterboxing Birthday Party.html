<br/>
I am not sure this whole topic is on topic here, but so far this isn't  <br/>
a large volume list, so I will reply to Kathie :) Let me know if you  <br/>
are interested or not in this as a podcast topic for a future podcast.<br/>
<br/>
I have two sons at home still age 6 and 9, and I am having their  <br/>
birthday party together. I have about 11 acres of conservation  <br/>
restricted land, and I abut the Great Meadows refuge and the Sudbury  <br/>
Valley Trustees (who have a box on their property next to me) I have  <br/>
invited about 30 kids, in both age groups, and mentioned that any  <br/>
adult that wants to stay is welcome. I have carved and hidden 5 boxes,  <br/>
which are planned to be planted in the wild after the party.<br/>
They are identical to my regular boxes except that I didn't put the  <br/>
ink and stamp in a bag for now.<br/>
<br/>
First I am going to have them make a stamp. I got the blocks from  <br/>
Letterbox Adventures, and I got foamie stickers from Michaels. Their  <br/>
goodie bag is a fanny pack, from Oriental trading, and it will have a  <br/>
log, compass and ink (not washable because that was too expensive)  <br/>
They are instructed to wear long pants and play clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Each box is hidden out of site of the others, so no one will see them  <br/>
being opened. I plan to divide them into 5 groups, age appropriate,  <br/>
and send each group out with an adult. I may or may not have one set  <br/>
of clues for each age group. I have a picture clue already for one of  <br/>
the boxes. I was also planning some decoding, and perhaps clues hidden  <br/>
along the way. I have some landmarks planted as well (one of those  <br/>
tree faces, chimes, a dog's grave)<br/>
<br/>
I was going to wait until all groups were back before sending them all  <br/>
out again. If the older ones were done really early, I could send them  <br/>
to the Wol-box next door, or even my King Philip's Wood ones at the  <br/>
end of the street.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted the boxes on Atlasquest so that they can log their  <br/>
finds, and I will give them a business card, with the urls. I am  <br/>
hoping some of them will continue after the party!<br/>
<br/>
I was going to have a cookout, but I may not because it is from 1-5 ish.<br/>
<br/>
That was all I had so far-any suggestions welcome, and please if you  <br/>
don't want to hear any more of this onlist, I can reply off<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not sure this whole topic is on topic here, but so <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;far this isn't  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a large volume list, so I will reply to Kathie :) Let me <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;know if you  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are interested or not in this as a podcast topic for a <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;future podcast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have two sons at home still age 6 and 9, and I am <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;having their  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; birthday party together. I have about 11 acres of <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;conservation  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; restricted land, and I abut the Great Meadows refuge and <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;the Sudbury  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Valley Trustees (who have a box on their property next <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;to me) I have  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; invited about 30 kids, in both age groups, and mentioned <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;that any  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; adult that wants to stay is welcome. I have carved and <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;hidden 5 boxes,  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; which are planned to be planted in the wild after the <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;party.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; They are identical to my regular boxes except that I <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;didn't put the  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ink and stamp in a bag for now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; First I am going to have them make a stamp. I got the <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;blocks from  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Letterbox Adventures, and I got foamie stickers from <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Michaels. Their  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; goodie bag is a fanny pack, from Oriental trading, and <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;it will have a  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; log, compass and ink (not washable because that was too <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;expensive)  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; They are instructed to wear long pants and play clothes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Each box is hidden out of site of the others, so no one <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;will see them  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; being opened. I plan to divide them into 5 groups, age <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;appropriate,  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and send each group out with an adult. I may or may not <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;have one set  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of clues for each age group. I have a picture clue <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;already for one of  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the boxes. I was also planning some decoding, and <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;perhaps clues hidden  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; along the way. I have some landmarks planted as well <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;(one of those  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tree faces, chimes, a dog's grave)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was going to wait until all groups were back before <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;sending them all  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; out again. If the older ones were done really early, I <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;could send them  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to the Wol-box next door, or even my King Philip's Wood <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;ones at the  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; end of the street.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have posted the boxes on Atlasquest so that they can <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;log their  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; finds, and I will give them a business card, with the <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;urls. I am  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hoping some of them will continue after the party!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was going to have a cookout, but I may not because it <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;is from 1-5 ish.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; That was all I had so far-any suggestions welcome, and <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;please if you  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; don't want to hear any more of this onlist, I can reply <br/>

I really like the idea of the digital voice recorder. It's a good way to build up a library of <br/>
material. I'm extensively going to visit my in laws this weekend who just happen to live <br/>
near Ithaca. Which just happens to be the Finger Lakes gathering weekend. No small <br/>
coincidence!<br/>
  I'd like to record some of the fun as Celtic Quinn trys to plant some 24+ cooties on folks. <br/>
I need to buy a recorder by tomorrow, so thanks John for the links. I have a Mac, so am I <br/>
going to be limited with my choices? I hope not.<br/>

&gt;It's a good way to build up a library of <br/>

&gt; coincidence!<br/>
&gt;  I'd like to record some of the fun as Celtic Quinn trys <br/>
&gt;to plant some 24+ cooties on folks. <br/>
&gt; I need to buy a recorder by tomorrow, so thanks John for <br/>
&gt;the links. I have a Mac, so am I <br/>
&gt; going to be limited with my choices? I hope not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care, Kathie<br/>
&gt; P.S. Mark and Sue- see you on Saturday!<br/>

&gt;&gt; So, my last letter didn't seem to post yet,<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; What a great party- lucky kids! I like the idea of <br/>
&gt;&gt;recording events <br/>
&gt;&gt; such as a letterboxing <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; birthday party so this begs the question, how is this <br/>
&gt;&gt;technically <br/>
&gt;&gt; done? I get the mic and <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; headphone connected to the computer concept but what <br/>
&gt;&gt;about field <br/>
&gt;&gt; recordings? A lot of <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; letterboxing podcasts that I'm thinking about might <br/>
&gt;&gt;involve away <br/>
&gt;&gt; from the computer stuff. <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; A prime example would be at an event.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; So John-help!<br/>

Don't worry, you're safe from a kid's birthday party. It's going to be  <br/>
hard enough for me and some of them are my kids, and some of the  <br/>
others are my Sunday School kids!<br/>
