                    <div class="plaintext-content">I created a new page today, one to thank our generous and selfless<br>
sponsors.  These are the folks who have put money in the Tip Jar.  I<br>
think its important to publically thank those who financially support<br>
the Letterpod.  As I say on the website, the fees for the Letterpod<br>
are about $5.00 a month.  This isn't a huge amount, but it does add up<br>
quickly, and I certainly can't support the cost over the long term.<br>
<br>
I do plan to sell some swag in the future (patches at least), so this<br>
will help offset cost also, but for now, we stay on the air with kind<br>
donations.<br>
<br>
If you would like to put some money in the kitty, you can do this with<br>
paypal.  If you do not want your name on this page, please let me know<br>
that, but I think those listed serve as good role models to others.<br>
