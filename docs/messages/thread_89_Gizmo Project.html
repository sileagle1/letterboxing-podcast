 This is similar to Skype if you know about computer telephony, but<br/>
Gizmo has one key advantage for me...you can record a phone conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Gizmo is a free download.  What you would need is some microphone on<br/>
your computer, whether built in or added on.  Then you can call other<br/>
computers that have Gizmo and talk for free, or you can call any<br/>
telephone in the world (US rates are like $0.01 a minute...pretty<br/>
cheap!)  So like I said, once you are talking...you can press a record<br/>
button and it will record the conversation, and save it on your<br/>
desktop as a .WAV file that you can then listen to in Quictime, or<br/>
whatever editing software you want to use.  I plan to use this to<br/>
record interviews with other letterboxers.  Wanted to send it along<br/>
for you...I like it so far.<br/>
