letterpod.podbean.com will be a great place to direct people to.<br>
<br>
I was a little intimidated at first but decided I need to stay current with technology or <br>
become a dinosaur. You know- "Back in my day, we had these round. flat pieces of vinyl <br>
that you needed to spin to hear the sound come out of them..." Sadly, that was back in my <br>
day!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, it's really not that hard and lot's of fun to create a podcast. So, good luck <br>
everyone. Try it. you'll like it :-)<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>
