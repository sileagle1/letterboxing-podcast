letterpod.podbean.com will be a great place to direct people to.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little intimidated at first but decided I need to stay current with technology or <br/>
become a dinosaur. You know- "Back in my day, we had these round. flat pieces of vinyl <br/>
that you needed to spin to hear the sound come out of them..." Sadly, that was back in my <br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it's really not that hard and lot's of fun to create a podcast. So, good luck <br/>
everyone. Try it. you'll like it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

&gt; &gt;I might like to give it a go  but am <br/>
&gt; &gt; totally clueless as to how to go about actually doing it other than<br/>
&gt; using  an <br/>
&gt; &gt; old cassette recorder and then wouldn't know how to get it from that<br/>
&gt; to the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; computer.  Do you use a digital recorder?  A microphone connected to<br/>
&gt; a  decent <br/>
&gt; &gt; laptop?  Inquiring minds want, no need to know these things!  <br/>
&gt; Please, do <br/>
&gt; &gt; share.  <br/>

&gt; No worries, gone are the days of popping in a cassette and hitting<br/>
&gt; record...didnt' we take that for granted!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, its more complicated now, but its not that much harder.  First<br/>
&gt; check out this new page I started to see if it helps..<br/>
&gt; http://letterpod.podbean.com/podcasting-basics/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like Orion said, basically you are now recording digitally, instead of<br/>
&gt; to a tape.  The sound is converted to a digital file, which when<br/>
&gt; played back sounds like sound.  So how do you record digitally.  Well,<br/>
&gt; lots of ways.  Maybe your laptop or computer has a built in microphone<br/>
&gt; already.  If not, you might need a mic.  As Orion said, you can get<br/>
&gt; one that plugs directly into your computer using USB.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or, you might have an mp3 player or iPod that can record, or do as<br/>
&gt; orion does and has an add-on to record.  There are high end digital<br/>
&gt; recorders too.  Maybe you have a MiniDisc recorder, that can work to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or, if you have none of these, a quick and dirty way is to go to<br/>
&gt; www.gabcast.com and set up a free account.  You can call a free phone<br/>
&gt; number and record yourself.  It will create a digital file for you. <br/>
&gt; The sound quality sounds like you are on a phone, but you will have<br/>
&gt; something!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then the next step is taking that file and cleaning and editing it up<br/>
&gt; a bit in an audio editing program like Garageband, or Audacity (which<br/>
&gt; is a freeware program online for PC and Mac's).  If this part<br/>
&gt; indimidates you, give the file to me and I'll work on it for you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then we post away!  I'll do that. So, if you have an idea, run with it<br/>
&gt; and we'll figure out a way to use it.  Let me know what you do and<br/>
&gt; don't have and I'll try to help however I can.<br/>
