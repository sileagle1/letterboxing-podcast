Quest has a pretty good one, although the one on the <br/>
website is too small. Maybe Ryan can give us access to the <br/>
original picture.<br/>

Getting an iPod on top would be a little tricky without <br/>
sending someone out specifically for the picture.<br/>

<div>I've been thinking about the Podcasts, John. I think we have to be careful as to not go overboard with them. Not sure what you are thinking for frequency of new content. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But like Ray Record's video of that first gathering in VT - less is more. If the boxing public becomes inundated with new podcasts every day - might it lessen the importance or meaning of them? Will the public become ammune to them vs. less frequent and more important features?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just playing devil's advocate here. What are your thoughts???</div></body></html>
