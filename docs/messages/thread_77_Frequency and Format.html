I'm picking up the ball and running with it here for Letterpod.  The<br>
old episodes are reposted on iTunes now under simply Letterpod, no<br>
longer "Letterboxing Podcast" though it will show up under searches<br>
for that as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point of this post is about future episodes, and the way<br>
we listen to them.<br>
<br>
One idea I had was on how frequently we can get out an episode.  I was<br>
thinking seasonally.  Under this model, we might get 4 a year, and the<br>
episodes would be chock full of features like Orion's Tales from the<br>
Trails, interviews, maybe some clues thrown in.  This format is a bit<br>
like a variety show.  Drawback, the finished product is rather long to<br>
listen to.<br>
<br>
Second idea is to still do all the same things...features, interviews,<br>
stories, etc....but release them as an episode when they are done,<br>
when we get them.  We'll still start them with an intro, but maybe it<br>
would be Leterpod: Tales from the Trial by Orion, and that is the<br>
whole episode.  This model is shorter, quicker to listen to, and we<br>
can keep them coming more often.  The next episode after that might be<br>
Letterpod: Interview with Randy Hall (just making stuff up here).<br>
<br>
What do people think?  Did I explain these enough?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like the idea of the quarterly/seasonal format. Unless, of course, there's enough to <br>
warrant more frequent episodes. I think interviews and audio clue boxes would be fun. <br>
<br>
I've been "collecting" sounds for my Tales From the Trails intro and my husband's going to <br>
contribute some guitar bits. I'm planning on getting some good material from this <br>
weekend's gathering in NH. I will fully charge my iPod, Lockwench :-)<br>
<br>
The Letterpod site looks wonderful, JackBear!<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>
