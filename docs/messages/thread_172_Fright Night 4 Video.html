                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm wrapping up post-production of the Fright Night 4 video.  I<br>
think I'm going to follow that up with a bloopers reel since there is<br>
some funny stuff that didn't make the final cut.<br>
<br>
The video is longer than years past, just because I couldn't seem to<br>
cut out fun stuff.  So, hopefully it isn't too unbearable to watch. <br>
Audio was kind of a disaster, as I was using a new computer I was a<br>
bit unfamilar with, and didn't have the settings right.  Hopefully the<br>
material is better than my limitations.<br>
<br>
I also plan to have some tales from Oldhounder.  I have two great<br>
stories he told me that were too long for the video.  Also, I finally<br>
got him and Dale End Farm to tell there 13th Body story, which has<br>
been hinted at since the earliest days of the letterpod.<br>
<br>
So, expect more videos in the coming months.<br>
<br>
I hope to polish off an audio episode this month, just need a few more<br>
key elements.  So, whoever gets me something first, I'm going with that!<br>
<br>
Hopefully we still have some listeners out there, since it has been so<br>
long since the last episode.<br>
