I am new to this list, and also to letterboxing, but very interested :)<br/>
I am going to be having a letterboxing birthday party for my 9 and 6 <br/>
year old sons on Sunday June 25th, and that might be a possible topic <br/>
for a future podcast. I don't know that it would be an initial <br/>
interest, though.<br/>
<br/>
I will listen to the sample podcast and see.<br/>

 How will you run a letterboxing B-day party? Cool idea. My mom used to send us on <br/>
scavenger hunts on our birthdays. I think it was to get rid of all the screaming kids :-)<br/>

Take care, Orion<br/>
