Thank God you know how to all the difficult stuff and we can just play!<br/>

Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. It was nice meeting you Lock Wench. Sorry I had to run but it was great to get to <br/>
Ithaca, if even for a short time!<br/>

the trunk next to my PLB The Great Houdini. Imagine, Houdini locked inside with the keys <br/>
right there and he couldn't get out! That's the best part of the whole story.<br/>
<br/>
And Lock Wench, your friends were lifesavers.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion/Kathie<br/>
P.S. Loch Wench- how do you record voice in Garageband? I'm just opening it up for the <br/>
first time. Looks great but there's a lot there.<br/>
