what everyone did and really liked the collaborative effort.<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a "Fairy" Tale from the Trail with Large Marge called "Little Red Hiding <br/>
Hood. It's still a work in process which means it's all in my head at this point. But I have a <br/>
small break in my projects, so it'll all come spilling out soon. What kind of deadline were <br/>
you thinking of? <br/>
<br/>
I like the creativity of this group and Jack Bear's oversight and technical talents.<br/>
Off to outline my contribution...<br/>

I set January 21st on the calendar as the deadline, but can extend if<br/>
we have things in the works.  I would like to have one out at the end<br/>
of January or early Feb.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I just noticed that this is a leap year, so we have Feb. 29th<br/>
this year.  Might be fun to put out a short bonus episode to<br/>
celebrate, let me know if you have anything fun we could do for this.<br/>
