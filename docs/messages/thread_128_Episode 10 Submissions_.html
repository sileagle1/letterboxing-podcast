what everyone did and really liked the collaborative effort.<br>
<br>
I'm working on a "Fairy" Tale from the Trail with Large Marge called "Little Red Hiding <br>
Hood. It's still a work in process which means it's all in my head at this point. But I have a <br>
small break in my projects, so it'll all come spilling out soon. What kind of deadline were <br>
you thinking of? <br>
<br>
I like the creativity of this group and Jack Bear's oversight and technical talents.<br>
Off to outline my contribution...<br>

I set January 21st on the calendar as the deadline, but can extend if<br>
we have things in the works.  I would like to have one out at the end<br>
of January or early Feb.<br>
<br>
Also, I just noticed that this is a leap year, so we have Feb. 29th<br>
this year.  Might be fun to put out a short bonus episode to<br>
celebrate, let me know if you have anything fun we could do for this.<br>
