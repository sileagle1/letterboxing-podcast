I would sit by the radio patiently waiting for Santa to say, "Now here is a letter from John, and he wants a new snowspeeder, walkie talkies, and a pac-man video game" (dating myself here).<br>
<br>
It was great fun....sooooooo....I WANT YOUR LETTERS TO SANTA with all your letterboxing hopes and desires for Christmas. I will select some for Santa to read on the December edition of the Letterpod. To sweeten the deal, I will also be selecting three folks that submit lists/letters at random to receive a Letterpod patch!<br>
<br>
So, think about what you want for Christmas from Santa, and drop me a line on AQ, and I'll pass it along to him!<br>
<br>
If you are looking for idea, you can always look around this website too:<br>

I will shamelessly plug letterboxers who are selling things, so you can be specific.<br>
