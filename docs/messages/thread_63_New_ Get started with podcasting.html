                    <div class="plaintext-content">CNET is the group that does free classes as a benefit for Best Buy <br>
customers. I buy quite a bit at Best Buy, so it's a natural for me. <br>
The class series are basic but cover every topic:  how to set up a <br>
home network,  how to transfer all your VHS home movies to DVD's, how <br>
to set up an interactive blog, etc etc.  And even though the classes <br>
are basic, the real value is the info relayed through the informal <br>
class discussions between the teacher of the class and the students. I <br>
like how they are set up as if you know NOTHING...but give choices to <br>
those who might already have SOME knowledge. <br>
<br>
Now if they would just do more MAC based stuff...   :)<br>
