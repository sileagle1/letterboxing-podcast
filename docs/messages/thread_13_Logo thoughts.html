I just had a thought about the photo/logo.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to prop an IPod on top of the Cranmere Pool box why not have a photo of <br/>
a video IPod with the picture of the Cranmere Pool box inserted on the screen instead? <br/>
That way the emphasis would be on the new technology and paying hommage to the roots <br/>
of the hobby. I'm just thinking that the scale of the IPod wouldn't read as effectively if it <br/>
were placed on top of the letterbox. It's just the flipside of the direction we've been <br/>
headed. Plus it seems like it would be a snap to create! I have a video IPod and I could take <br/>
a digital photo of it to send you.<br/>
<br/>
 Also, if you like, I'm an illustrator by profession and my husband, Ron, is a graphic <br/>
designer and we could create an image for the logo. That way you'd get exactly what you <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
Two ideas.<br/>

&gt; I loved the BBC Radio Play! Thanks for the treat. "Give me <br/>
&gt; stamps!" It would be great to get something creative into <br/>
&gt; the podcast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd rather have a .com as well, but I don't think the <br/>
&gt; domain is very important.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless we can find something to add, the first episode is <br/>
&gt; going to be pretty dull stuff with just the background <br/>
&gt; info on how to get started letterboxing. We really need to <br/>
&gt; get interviews and clues to a podcast letterbox to get <br/>
&gt; things going but that can be in the second episode. I may <br/>
&gt; actually need to split it into two parts to keep the size <br/>
&gt; manageble but I'll see how big it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm hoping to get the first episode out in June then <br/>
&gt; monthly after that.<br/>

I see what you mean about an IPod on an IPod. I just thought that the image of the IPod on <br/>
the Cranmere box just might not show up well due to it's relatively small scale.<br/>

If we're just going to paste an image of the iPod on Cranmere Pool, we<br/>
don't have to keep the sizes proportionately correct. The iPod could<br/>
be as large as the letterbox! Not realistic, of course, but realism<br/>
isn't a particularly high goal in this case, I think.<br/>

<br/>
As far as the first podcast goes, I feel like it's your baby so you should create it's content. <br/>
The idea of introducing letterboxing is the way to go.  <br/>
<br/>
But after #1, I'd love to jump in with ideas! I think the sky's the limit. I especially like the <br/>
ideas of interviews and radio style pieces a la NPR. Perhaps going on a letterbox jaunt and <br/>
recording that. I even think we could do our own version of a letterbox play. This is such a <br/>
great creative outlet. Good job, John. Can't wait to download the premier podcat!<br/>
