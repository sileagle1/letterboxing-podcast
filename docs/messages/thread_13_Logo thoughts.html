I just had a thought about the photo/logo.<br>
 <br>
Instead of trying to prop an IPod on top of the Cranmere Pool box why not have a photo of <br>
a video IPod with the picture of the Cranmere Pool box inserted on the screen instead? <br>
That way the emphasis would be on the new technology and paying hommage to the roots <br>
of the hobby. I'm just thinking that the scale of the IPod wouldn't read as effectively if it <br>
were placed on top of the letterbox. It's just the flipside of the direction we've been <br>
headed. Plus it seems like it would be a snap to create! I have a video IPod and I could take <br>
a digital photo of it to send you.<br>

 Also, if you like, I'm an illustrator by profession and my husband, Ron, is a graphic <br>

I see what you mean about an IPod on an IPod. I just thought that the image of the IPod on <br>
the Cranmere box just might not show up well due to it's relatively small scale.<br>

I do like the image of the Cranmere box.<br>

If we're just going to paste an image of the iPod on Cranmere Pool, we<br>
don't have to keep the sizes proportionately correct. The iPod could<br>
be as large as the letterbox! Not realistic, of course, but realism<br>
isn't a particularly high goal in this case, I think.<br>

I've updated the podcast image with an ipod. What do you think?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it looks perfect. Ryan's right, no need for it to look like a "still life"- it's better as a <br>
graphic image. I like that the image on the screen is of the box because it brings it full <br>
circle.<br>
<br>
As far as the first podcast goes, I feel like it's your baby so you should create it's content. <br>
The idea of introducing letterboxing is the way to go.  <br>
<br>
But after #1, I'd love to jump in with ideas! I think the sky's the limit. I especially like the <br>
ideas of interviews and radio style pieces a la NPR. Perhaps going on a letterbox jaunt and <br>
recording that. I even think we could do our own version of a letterbox play. This is such a <br>
great creative outlet. Good job, John. Can't wait to download the premier podcat!<br>

Something about that theater of the mind thing! That's why podcasts are so great. <br>
