Having come into letterboxing late, just started LBing in beginning of March 
2007 I never got to hear one of these podcasts, so I say go for it.  If you

I love listening to all my different podcasts and I think Choi had a brilliant idea. Unless <br>
more folks stepped forward to contribute, it's not fair for Choi to do all the recording. I did <br>
a few and it was a blast but I don't want to hog the show.<br>

So, if anyone else wants to contribute, I'd be game to do more :-)<br>

<div>I have gotten no emails or anything since I signed up for this 
  list.  Having come into letterboxing late, just started LBing in 
  beginning of March 2007 I never got to hear one of these podcasts, so I say go 
  for it.  If you make them we will listen.</div>
