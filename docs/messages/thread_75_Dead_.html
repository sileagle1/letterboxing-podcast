<div>I have gotten no emails or anything since I signed up for this list.  
Having come into letterboxing late, just started LBing in beginning of March 
2007 I never got to hear one of these podcasts, so I say go for it.  If you 
make them we will listen.</div>

I love listening to all my different podcasts and I think Choi had a brilliant idea. Unless <br/>
more folks stepped forward to contribute, it's not fair for Choi to do all the recording. I did <br/>
a few and it was a blast but I don't want to hog the show.<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone else wants to contribute, I'd be game to do more :-)<br/>

Take care, Orion<br/>

some if I knew how and after I had heard a few to get an idea of what the format 
was like.</div>

&gt;  &gt; So is this dead?  I see the link http://www.letterpod.net no longer<br/>
&gt;  &gt; goes to the home page, I guess whoever was paying the $$$ for the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; domain decided to call it quits.  Too bad really, I think this was a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; great idea.  Would anyone else like to see it come back.  I'm set up<br/>
&gt;  &gt; to record, if we need someone.  Sigh..<br/>

<div>I have gotten no emails or anything since I signed up for this 
  list.  Having come into letterboxing late, just started LBing in 
  beginning of March 2007 I never got to hear one of these podcasts, so I say go 
  for it.  If you make them we will listen.</div>
