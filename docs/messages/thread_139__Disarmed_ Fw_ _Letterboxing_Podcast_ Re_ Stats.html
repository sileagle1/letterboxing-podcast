Thanks for your suggestion.  I use AQ about every 30 minutes..LOL! <br>
I'm an addict.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I have talked to Ryan.  Not specifically about putting a link on<br>
his opening page, but he has the Letterpod listed as an RSS feed that<br>
everyone can see on their "My Page".  I usually posts to several of<br>
the boards there also when I release and episode, as well as lots of<br>
other yahoo groups.<br>
<br>
But, we should probably ask about getting "letterpod" put in the<br>
glossary and wiki and stuff like that.  Probably aren't many links to<br>
it outside of the forums (and my profile...hhahaha).<br>
<br>
Thanks, I'll look into this when Ryan gets back.<br>
