<div>Hi John,</div>
<div>Have you ever considered contacting <a href="mailto:Ryan@atlasquest">Ryan@atlasquest</a> to put something like an 
invitation to listen on the opening page of that website? I'm sure he would do 
something. Zillions of boxers go to that site daily.</div>

Thanks for your suggestion.  I use AQ about every 30 minutes..LOL! <br/>
I'm an addict.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I have talked to Ryan.  Not specifically about putting a link on<br/>
his opening page, but he has the Letterpod listed as an RSS feed that<br/>
everyone can see on their "My Page".  I usually posts to several of<br/>
the boards there also when I release and episode, as well as lots of<br/>
other yahoo groups.<br/>
<br/>
But, we should probably ask about getting "letterpod" put in the<br/>
glossary and wiki and stuff like that.  Probably aren't many links to<br/>
it outside of the forums (and my profile...hhahaha).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I'll look into this when Ryan gets back.<br/>
