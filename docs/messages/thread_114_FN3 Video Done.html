I'm happy to say the FN3 video is finished and looks great :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm  figuring how to post it on Ron's company ftp site or my .mac server, so Jack Bear can <br/>
retrieve it. It comes in around 5 and 1/2 minutes and should make lots of boxers smile. <br/>
Ron's good!<br/>
My recording of Tales from the Trails had to be moved to tomorrow. So, it'll be a tie <br/>
getting the audio and video sent but they'll be on their way real soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who faced the camera and shared their scary stories. Hobo camps, <br/>
lightning and getting lost seems to be a common thread!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. More micro memos have appeared in our local Marshall's and T.J. Maxx stores again. <br/>
You won't regret buying these recorders if you have iPods and want to record easily :-)<br/>

&gt;           ... I can hear it being tweeked in Ron's studio! <br/>
&gt; I actually sat down and watched what he has so far.<br/>
&gt; So far, so good!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In order to keep the file from being massive, we're trying to keep it under 5 minutes. <br/>
There <br/>
&gt; will be a fair amount of editing but the overall effect's great. I think Ron will have this <br/>
ready <br/>
&gt; real soon :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I really want to urge folks to record their boxing stories and send them to either <br/>
Jack <br/>
&gt; Bear or me for the Tales From the Trails portion of the podcast. Basically, I need stories <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; don't have to record them "live". The Tales from the Trails intro can be followed by me <br/>
saying <br/>
&gt; "here's the story of _______ about the time they ___________. Help me fill in the blanks!<br/>
&gt; Right now, I'm twisting Eidilon's arm to record one that involves boxing and what they <br/>
&gt; discovered and brought home :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So buy digital recorders and share the fun!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care, Orion<br/>
