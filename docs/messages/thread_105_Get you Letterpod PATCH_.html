Letterpod Patches are NOW available.  You can order here:<br>
http://letterpod.podbean.com/patch/<br>
<br>
The "purple" turned out much more blue then I expected, but they still<br>
look pretty sharp.  I had several people comment to me about the<br>
Letterpod logo, and wanting to purchase a patch.  I figured this would<br>
be a good way to continue to offset internet hosting charges for the<br>
letterpod, and be a good marketing device for listeners.<br>
<br>
All proceeds will go to maintaining and improving the letterpod.  When<br>
supplies run out, I will probably to with a new design (ahem).<br>
<br>
Well, I hope you like them and will spread the word.<br>
