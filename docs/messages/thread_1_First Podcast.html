Letterboxing Podcast and a few minutes of history and information on<br/>
getting started letterboxing. I expect to have it completed by 6/11/06. <br/>
<br/>
The next thing to plan is where to host the podcast. The obvious<br/>
choices are letterboxing.org or atlasquest.com. I'll talk to Ryan to<br/>
see what he thinks...<br/>
<br/>
We're also going to need a picture to go with the podcast.<br/>

thinking of us to be a part of this. As we discussed on the phone, <br/>
there are so many uses for this that my mind is swimming with ideas.<br/>

I'm headed home now for a 35 minute commute but something tells me I <br/>
won't mind the ride at all - I'll be deep in thought.<br/>
