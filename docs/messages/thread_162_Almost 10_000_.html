visit!<br>
<br>
At the time this message was posted, we are at 9955.<br>
<br>
This is kind of an odd number because Podbean keeps track of Site<br>
Visitors...this is it's definition:<br>
"Site Visitors, as it's called, gives the number of visitors to your<br>
podcast site. To prevent any type of fake or redundant data, any<br>
number of visitors with the same IP address will be counted only once<br>
in a 24-hour period."<br>
<br>
So it doesn't mean 10,000 different computers have come to Letterpod,<br>
nor does it mean the total number of times the site has been visited.<br>
 Something in between.<br>
<br>
I want to thank you all for making this podcast so successful and<br>
making it to this milestone.<br>
<br>
If no one was listening, and no one was contributing, then this would<br>
be happening.  I'm sure we'll reach 20,000 before you know it!<br>
<br>
I know that some websites probably have this many visits in a day!  AQ<br>
has 10,000 messages on the message boards a month...so we're small<br>
grapes...but that is OK.  I'm not trying to be HUGE here...just want<br>
to make sure that the people who want to listen...know about us.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone.<br>

<br>
I like what we're doing here and I know a lot of people comment on enjoying the podcasts. <br>
I find it a great creative outlet and it's a good educational tool as well.<br>
<br>
Long live the Letterpod!!<br>
<br>
More letterboxers ought to try recording stuff and submitting them. There are many digital <br>
recording devices. Like I've said in the past, my favorite is the Micromemo. I bought mine <br>
at Marshall's and it just pops on my iPod and it's all set up to record. So easy.<br>
<br>
Plus, it has a good sound quality.  You can record family members recounting family <br>
history, tape message reminders etc. If anyone's toying with the idea of recording <br>
something, I say go for it. It's lot's of fun!<br>
