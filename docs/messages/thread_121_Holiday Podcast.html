Christmas can you get people to sing their lines over the phone? That would be cool.<br>

Reading a letterbox version of The Night Before Christmas and singing the 12 Days will <br>
certainlly give the podcast a holiday spin!<br>

<br>
If you want to sing one of the Days, call the Gabcast # and record you<br>
rself singing that "Day".  You DON'T have to say "On the XYZ day of<br>
Christmas my true love gave to me  XYZ."...just say the last<br>
XYZ...like "Two Turtle Doves."  I'll have joystar take care of the<br>
other parts.  Then post here which day you took so no one else sings<br>
that day.<br>
<br>
Call: 1-800-749-0632<br>

I'll edit it all together, and lay down the music behind it.  Does<br>
this sound alright?<br>

Not sure how my singing is but I think you can understand the words, so that's the main <br>
thing :-)<br>
This is going to be fun!<br>

P.S. The Gabfest is very cool way to get things recorded. The conference feature definitely <br>
would be worth exploring. Any takers yet Jackbear?<br>
