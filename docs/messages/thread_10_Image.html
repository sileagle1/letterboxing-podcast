<br/>
 I had one of those Homer Simpson moments this morning,,, Doh!  I made the connection <br/>
between the origins of letterboxing to the future of letterboxing through one image. The <br/>
IPod probably would have looked too small on top of the box. The scale probably wouldn't <br/>
have allowed it to be dynamic enough whereas the type is. Great job!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the domain name is picked and the image looks great, now for the fun part!<br/>

I think it would be great if we could get a picture of an <br/>
iPod at the pool through Mark's contacts at Dartmoor. Or <br/>
maybe a local boxer with an iPod next to the box.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be happy to let anyone else take a shot at the image. <br/>
It needs to be 300x300 pixel jpeg.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Where did you get the Seinnhauser set, John?<br/>
I picked mine up from Amazon.com <br/>
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001MHYK6/002-2293782-1536052?v=glance&amp;n=172282<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe you could explain the process of creating a <br/>
&gt;podcast. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo has a better explanation that I could write. <br/>

John, thanks for the links. You're right- the yahoo explaination is pretty darn good. Now I <br/>
need to go educate myself....<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Kathie<br/>
