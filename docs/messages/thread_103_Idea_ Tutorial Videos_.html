                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe this is off topic or out of the mission of Letterpod, however I<br>
am compelled to share it to see what others think.<br>
<br>
The Fright Night video is and has been the most<br>
downloaded/feeded/streamed file on the Letterpod so far.  This is<br>
probably no surprise, since more americans watch TV, as opposed to<br>
listen to the radio.  People like to "see" things as well as listen to<br>
them.  The funny/strange part is that this file is also the LARGEST,<br>
and  takes longer to load then the other stuff.  Anyway...<br>
<br>
Because video is so popular, I am compelled to accept video.  I<br>
suppose we could host gathering video (certainly if it was as well<br>
produced as the fright night video), video that are clues to<br>
letterboxes, and finally to my original idea....tutorial videos.<br>
<br>
I think DIY is very popular in letterboxing, and I think people are<br>
interested in how others do things.  I don't know if these would be<br>
redundant though....I mean there are some great web tutorials out<br>
there already on carving a stamp, I'm not sure a video would improve<br>
on this or just take up bandwidth.  But for newer letterboxers, seeing<br>
a video on how to transfer with tracing paper, versus acetone, versus<br>
blender pen, or with an iron, or buther paper, or whatever, might be<br>
very useful.  I know I have never really seen the iron thing.<br>
<br>
I think that there might be more video camera and web cameras out<br>
there then microphones, so this might be really cool way for folks to<br>
contribute.<br>
<br>
So what do you all think, should we advertise this kind of thing?  I<br>
can certainly do a sample so everybody could see the potential (I just<br>
watched an online tutorial yesterday on iMovie, and it would be super<br>
easy).<br>

<br>
On the Letterpod home page you can see that on the left under<br>
"Content" different categories.  When one clicks on one of these it<br>
only give items in that category, and I can dogmark these under<br>
videos, or make a new categories as well.<br>
<br>
Those are some good topics you listed too!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the compliment, I have a real fun time doing the<br>
interviews...I try not to sound like an idiot, but sometimes I can't<br>
help it! hahaha.<br>

We're planning on filming another Frightnight video. This one about scary boxing stories...<br>

One of my favorite podcasts is The Official Lost podcast with Carlton Cuse and Damon <br>
Lindeloff. They record mostly audio but throw in a video podcast every once and awhile. <br>
iI's a real treat and I can see that working here, as well.<br>

I love the idea of video as well as audio.  I usually don't end up putting these on my ipod but just listening them to on my computer.  You can also attach PowerPoint or pictures to go along with the audio not just ongoing video from a video camera.  There are so many crazy options.  These could be special podcasts.  I like having the variety.  That's my opinion.<br/>Jen (Cooties)<br/><br/><blockquote><hr/>To: Letterboxing_Podcast@yahoogroups.com<br/>From: johnjballou@hotmail.com<br/>Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2007 13:56:47 +0000<br/>Subject: [Letterboxing_Podcast] Idea?

            Maybe this is off topic or out of the mission of Letterpod, however I<br/>
am compelled to share it to see what others think.<br/>
<br/>
The Fright Night video is and has been the most<br/>
downloaded/feeded/<wbr>streamed file on the Letterpod so far.  This is<br/>
probably no surprise, since more americans watch TV, as opposed to<br/>
listen to the radio.  People like to "see" things as well as listen to<br/>
them.  The funny/strange part is that this file is also the LARGEST,<br/>
and  takes longer to load then the other stuff.  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Because video is so popular, I am compelled to accept video.  I<br/>
suppose we could host gathering video (certainly if it was as well<br/>
produced as the fright night video), video that are clues to<br/>
letterboxes, and finally to my original idea....tutorial videos.<br/>
<br/>
I think DIY is very popular in letterboxing, and I think people are<br/>
interested in how others do things.  I don't know if these would be<br/>
redundant though....I mean there are some great web tutorials out<br/>
there already on carving a stamp, I'm not sure a video would improve<br/>
on this or just take up bandwidth.  But for newer letterboxers, seeing<br/>
a video on how to transfer with tracing paper, versus acetone, versus<br/>
blender pen, or with an iron, or buther paper, or whatever, might be<br/>
very useful.  I know I have never really seen the iron thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there might be more video camera and web cameras out<br/>
there then microphones, so this might be really cool way for folks to<br/>
contribute.<br/>
<br/>
So what do you all think, should we advertise this kind of thing?  I<br/>
can certainly do a sample so everybody could see the potential (I just<br/>
watched an online tutorial yesterday on iMovie, and it would be super<br/>
easy).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've actually always wanted to put video tutorials on Atlas Quest. I<br>
haven't for several reasons: The first being that I don't have a<br>
digital video camera, and the second being that I don't want to be the<br>
person giving the tutorial. =) <br>
<br>
If you can set up some video tutorials, though, by all means, I think<br>
there would be a lot of people who would really enjoy one if it was<br>
put together well. Granted, there are web tutorials already out there,<br>
but sometimes people just do better when they can see the movements<br>
involved and listen to the audio track instead of reading the<br>
material. I'm a reader myself, but I bet there would be a HUGE demand<br>
for video tutorials. *nodding* <br>
