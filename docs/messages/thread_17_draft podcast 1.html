mentioned what kind of products to buy. I found letterboxing a tad bit overwhelming <br/>
when I first started.<br/>
<br/>
 I have to stamp where? What's a signature stamp? Clues???<br/>
<br/>
Reading the boards helped but I like the idea of it all being spelled out the way you did in <br/>
pocast #1. The music gave it a nice polished touch and your voice sounded like a pro. <br/>
Seems like all the bases were covered plus there's always future podcasts.  I like the tips <br/>
and tricks angles you want to pursue. Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. Can't wait to download it to my IPod. Thanks for thinking of it and then doing it. <br/>

<br/>
I don't know how it could happen but there's some pretty funny and clever boxers out <br/>
there that are just plain entertaining. Maybe some kind of round table format. One of my <br/>
favorite podcasts is the official Lost Podcast. The writers just talk among themselves and <br/>
answer viewer's e-mail questions. I just find it so interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I'd certainly enjoy hear humorous boxing stories. Kind of like sitting around the campfire, <br/>
telling tales. Heck- we could even call it Sitting Around the Campfire!<br/>
<br/>
Just throwing things out there...<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

Happy to. Can you help find replacements that are pod safe? :o)<br/>

<br/>
Not really. It took me a half hour just to download that mp3, so<br/>
surfing around for pod-safe music is an unbelievably slow process for<br/>
me. Stupid dial-up connections. =)<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could try to play something on a harmonica and I'd let you<br/>
have it for free. I don't promise it'll be any good, but it<br/>
*definitely* won't sound like a cheap lounge act. ;o)<br/>
