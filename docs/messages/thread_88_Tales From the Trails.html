                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally found some breathing room and recorded my first Tales from the Trails. What fun!<br>
I kind of forgot how to create tracks in GarageBand but it was like getting back on a bike. <br>
No problem.<br>
<br>
I recorded my audio directly to my iPod via an attached Micromemo mic. The recording <br>
mode comes up automatically and you just click once and you're good to go. The quality is <br>
outstanding. Then I uploaded the recordings to iTunes. After opening my GarageBand file, <br>
I just dragged the iTune file onto the track I was working on. It was so easy!<br>
<br>
I just wanted to share this with folks who might be considering making a podcast. The <br>
Micromemo is a godsend and makes it so easy (no, I don't work for them...).<br>
<br>
JackBear, I sent the file by way of yousendit.com. Please let me know if you didn't get it. <br>
That's a great site :-)<br>
<br>
Take care, Orion<br>
P.S. Installment 2 is just about done and will be sent shortly.<br>

Orion...I had actually forgotten that you were recording us for your <br>
Tales from the Trails at Bear Brook!  It was weird to hear it all <br>

And finally, that interview with Wassamatta U was just SO great!  LOL  <br>

Great to have you back on board.  I think we should be getting close<br>
on the next episode, I know there were lots of things being done out<br>
there.  So, lets shoot for getting in any submissions for the next<br>
episode in the next week or so (if you need an extension, let me know.)  <br>

You should have recorded the adventures of CPAScott and I this weekend <br>
in Cape Cod.  The highlight?  Encountering a drunk guy in a cemetery <br>
who started yelling at me and then decided to follow me...had to grab <br>
the box, jump in the car, and as we were driving away, the guy <br>
actually pantomimed shooting at us with a rifle!  We were scared to <br>
return, so had to hide the box at another location! Hopefully one of <br>
our Cape Queens will return the box to its proper location for us.<br>
<br>
We had a great time visiting with CCL, AScrew and CCLB down Cape.  <br>
Camping, Power Boxing, and Night Boxing with the coyotes...what else <br>
could be better?<br>
<br>
