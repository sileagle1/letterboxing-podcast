I was thinking of running into Portland this evening to pick one up <br>
at best buy or circuit city perhaps...<br>
<br>
What was the cost on the one you picked up Choi?<br>
<br>
I was thinking of one in the $50.00 range....<br>
Although I will have to check out the one MM<br>
is suggesting....<br>
