<br/>
He pointed out that this is a great way for someone to contribute who<br/>
may not have the means, expertise, time, money, etc. to contribute by<br/>
writing or submitting a news item and having someone who can record it<br/>
read it do the voicework.<br/>
<br/>
I can envision people who may want to tell about an upcoming<br/>
gathering, or tell about a special event or box that is coming up. <br/>
Stuff that people put on blogs and make post about.  There are always<br/>
special projects people are doing...like letterboxes for the troops,<br/>
or for Steve Irwin or those memorial type boxes.  Or maybe an<br/>
announcement about a flood that wiped out a hundred boxes in some<br/>
area.  I think there is a lot of potential for a segment like this,<br/>
and it would be a way for people to contribute in an off air kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>

I think that the technical end may keep some people away but they'd still like to <br/>
contribute. The news is something we could all use. Keeping track of gatherings etc. <br/>
would be another good use of the podcast. Perhaps regional contributors ...<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. I also like audio clues for letterboxes as another feature.<br/>
