<br/>
I am Diana Wood, DEF Dale End Farm<br/>
My Yahoo name comes from a previous addiction.<br/>
I am new to letterboxing, but it is something that allows me to<br/>
combine a lot of my passions into one, and I don't see it waning as an<br/>
interest!<br/>
<br/>
I will probably lurk here for a while, until I see what I can<br/>
contribute to the discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the invite John<br/>

PS I just thought of one subject I will be expert on after June 25th,<br/>
which will be: Hosting a Letterboxing Birthday Party =:o (for a 7 and<br/>
10 year old) But I would expect that this would come later on in the<br/>
series...perhaps I can get a hold of some equipment before hand to do<br/>
the recording.<br/>
<br/>
Will the podcasts have graphic components?<br/>

I can't wait to work something up and listen to what others offer...<br/>
