<br/>
I like it. *nodding* I think I'd have to hear the music in context to<br/>
decide which I like best, but I definitely think there's good stuff there.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I was just listening to the podcast again and was<br/>
wondering about all the introductory stuff about the website, talk<br/>
list, and such. Does that have to be at the beginning of the podcast?<br/>
I'm not sure what the standards are in a podcast since I never heard<br/>
one before, but it seems less intrusive to put it at the end like<br/>
credits in a movie. <br/>
