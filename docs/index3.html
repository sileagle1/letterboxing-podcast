                        A mystery related item:  if memory serves, Knights of Columbo recently published a short mystery story wrapped around letterboxing.  There is an idea in there somewhere.

                        Sorry to all you letterpod fans!  We are overdue for the next episode.

theme, then starting with Episode 11, we'll try to do theme related stuff.

I would like to release a podcast on our leap year...

                        Anybody working on anything yet for Ep. 10?
